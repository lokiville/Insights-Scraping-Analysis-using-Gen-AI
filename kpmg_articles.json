Share In the current era of unprecedented global change, businesses are navigating several geopolitical risks that can profoundly impact their operations and growth. For several years, geopolitical and political uncertainties have topped our list of CEO concerns.1 Recent conversations with business leaders have revealed that these risks are no longer theoretical—they have real, tangible effects on strategic and operational decisions. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the five most pressing geopolitical challenges that organizations will face in the near term. Each of these areas presents unique challenges, yet they can also offer opportunities for organizations to adapt and innovate. By treating risk as an asset, leaders can align enterprise risk management with strategic objectives, positioning their organizations to thrive in a world of uncertainty. As global geopolitics continue to shift, staying ahead of the curve is essential for maintaining a competitive edge. By treating geopolitical risk as a fundamental part of business strategy, companies cannot only address threats but also seize opportunities, paving the way for growth and success. Office Managing Partner - Mumbai & Head - Risk Advisory KPMG in India KPMG’s “Top Geopolitical Risks 2025” report comes at a pivotal moment. The resurgence of trade protectionism—exemplified by the recent tariff measures announced by the Trump administration—signals not just a policy shift, but a structural reshaping of global commerce. We’re witnessing the fragmentation of long-standing economic alliances, as countries recalibrate trade and investment relationships in response to shifting geopolitical priorities. As quoted in the report, there were 3,000+ “harmful” trade interventions implemented in 2024, a significant increase from just 500 a decade earlier. Additionally, the report’s identification of “tectonic shifts” in power and economic centers, coupled with a fragmented regulatory and tax landscape, has real-world implications for cross-border business. For instance, while 140 countries agreed to the global minimum tax rules, many countries including the US have already withdrawn or stalled implementation. This dissonance introduces complexity and risk, particularly for companies navigating multinational footprints. Perhaps most telling is the evolution of the tech risk landscape. Generative AI is a case in point—it’s fast-moving, politicized, and largely unregulated. Businesses are caught between innovation and compliance, with geopolitical tensions only heightening that uncertainty. Add to this the reality of multi-layered supply chain risks—spanning conflict zones, climate threats, and cyber vulnerabilities—and we’re looking at a radically altered risk canvas. With most of the global trade exposed to some form of geopolitical influence, organizations must reimagine resilience. This is no longer about reacting to isolated shocks—it’s about anticipating structural volatility. Boards and executive teams must embed geopolitical scenario planning into strategy, elevate tech and regulatory foresight, and double down on operational flexibility. As the report rightly notes, geopolitics is now a boardroom issue—ignoring it is not an option. In our report, we have identified five critical trends: New trade alliances and investment hubs are redefining global power dynamics. The US is imposing tariffs, eliciting retaliatory responses, while new economic ‘nodes’ are emerging outside of traditional investment centers. Regulations and tax are evolving at different speeds in different geographies. Minimum global tax is becoming adopted by many countries, while others are withdrawing from multilateral tax policy. Shifting alliances (based upon national security concerns) and fragmented regulations add to complexity, while the emergence of new Generative AI (Gen AI) players challenges US dominance. Regulators are struggling to keep pace with new Gen AI solutions, and a rolling back of regulations could leave AI models out of control. Geopolitical competition in AI and other technologies (i.e. quantum computing) is creating technological blocs around the US and China, thus jeopardizing international cooperation and access. Geopolitical rivalries, trade protectionism, conflict, competition for resources, cyberattacks and climate events place severe strains on globally exposed businesses. Wars and tensions pose rising threats to key shipping choke points. Countries are adopting protectionist measures to safeguard and diversify their supply chains, including energy, food and critical minerals. Aging populations, mass retirement, falling birth rates (in developed markets), changing worker preferences, culture wars, AI integration and reskilling bring major workforce challenges. The world has become a much more geopolitically complex place, and these complexities are only expected to grow. Business leaders need to focus on building strategies and frameworks that take their geopolitical response from reactive to proactive, including developing holistic geopolitical risk management approaches. Following are five key steps business leaders can think about today to help mitigate risk and capitalize on opportunities: The report presents insights derived from extensive research, data analysis and case studies, including interviews and workshops with more than 100 KPMG professionals working across many global sectors and with clients of all sizes. Our secondary research includes KPMG reports, literature, academic papers, industry reports, and intergovernmental organization publications.

So, if volatility is the new normal, companies should treat geopolitical risk as an asset as well as a threat, aligning risk\nmanagement with strategic objectives. When addressing the five key risks in this paper, organizations should assess both the potential negative impacts and the opportunities:\n01\nTectonic shifts in power, economic centers and trade can enable a pivot to new regions, localizing supply chains and seeking new investment sources.\n02\nFaced with a complex, fragmented regulatory and tax environment, companies should adapt by increasing capabilities to monitor and respond, and identifying upsides of the green transition.\n03\nA fast-moving and politicized technology landscape calls for a rethink of the IT infrastructure footprint, trusted use of AI, and enhanced cybersecurity and energy efficiency.\n04\nMultiple threats to supply chains, assets and infrastructure require alternative sourcing strategies, including circular supply chains and resilient infrastructure.\n05\nIn response to demographic, technological and cultural pressures on workforces, companies should rethink the employee value proposition, integrate AI and humans, and improve mobility management.\n43 | Top geopolitical risks 2025 © 2025 Copyright owned by one or more of the KPMG International entities.

Scroll down to see 10 emerging trends we believe will emerge in 2025, our predictions for the year ahead and a new view on infrastructure reset. Chintan Patel Partner, Deal Advisory - Transport and Logistics KPMG in India This year, we expect to see significant competition between states to attract and capture patient capital. A lack of supply chain standards will likely drive up costs, which can undermine efficiency and affect the environment. Sustainability is moving from a matter of principle into – simply – good business sense. People have been talking about digital twins for decades. Finally, the pieces are in place to start turning models into value. As infrastructure assets get smarter, a more dynamic approach to asset management is needed. Engineering and construction firms are under massive pressure to deliver more for less. Asset owners and operators need to reassess their assumptions about the health and longevity of their portfolios. Delivering the future infrastructure pipeline will likely require a complete reset of global construction and delivery capabilities. The energy transition is entering a new phase driven by economic pragmatism. The past four years have been a bonanza for global shipping lines and their investors. Has the party ended?

Share The pharmaceutical supply chain is confronted with various risks that can significantly affect both operational efficiency and public health outcomes. Our Point of View (PoV) provides information on key issues such as bribery and corruption, emergence of counterfeit medications, environmental factors and damages, supply chain manipulation characterised by fraud or misrepresentation of products and theft, and diversion of pharmaceutical products, whether occurring during manufacturing, transit, or at distribution points, demonstrated through our experience in conducting risk assessments for clients and outlines the regulatory requirements of the industry. In order to manage the risks within supply chain, pharmaceutical companies must put appropriate measures in place to monitor and control the supply chain’s operational activities. Due diligence plays a major role in mitigating these supply chain risks – financial, operational, ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance), reputational, quality control, legal and compliance, regulatory, concentration, among other risks. In recent years, the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry has undergone significant changes driven by stringent regulatory requirements in disclosures, technological progress, the growth of remote care, shifting consumer habits towards innovative products, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the emergence of new competitors in the market. Acknowledging the opportunity for expansion, governments across the world have initiated efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated by country-specific regulatory authorities. Considering the potential risks such as legal, financial, operational, and environmental risks, it is imperative for pharmaceutical manufacturers to have a thorough understanding of the regulatory authorities that oversee their operations in order to mitigate the risks associated with non-compliance. Regulatory approvals are mandatory in the U.S., Europe, and other regions across the globe for the introduction of new pharmaceuticals and medical devices into the market, as well as at each stage of the supply chain including raw material supply, manufacturing, distribution, and marketing, etc. Pharmaceutical companies are increasingly depending on supply chains to tap into specialised expertise, cut costs, speed up product delivery, and manage logistics more effectively. However, throughout the supply chain stages, the third-parties have violated several regulations set by regulatory authorities. This reliance on supply chains exposes them to various risks, including regulatory, reputational, and operational risks. Pharmaceutical companies depend on third-parties for various reasons, including gaining specialised knowledge and resources, reducing costs, and managing logistics. Adhering to regulatory standards is essential and cannot be compromised in the pharmaceutical industry. Regulatory agencies formulate guidelines and regulations governing all aspects of the pharmaceutical process, including research and development, manufacturing, distribution, and marketing. Regulatory risks within the pharmaceutical supply chain may encompass instances of non-compliance with established regulations, potentially resulting in delays in shipments or rejection by customs authorities. Due diligence on their supply chains can help to identify and assess potential risks, which can assist pharmaceutical companies in effectively mitigating these risks.

Share The digital landscape continues to evolve at pace – unleashing significant challenges and a sense of urgency amid the need for robust cybersecurity measures. Ubiquitous digital connections and fast-emerging technologies such as AI appear to be redefining almost every facet of our professional and personal lives, making cybersecurity not just a business concern but a universal issue that affects all aspects of society. The KPMG 2024 India CEO Outlook reveals that CEOs view cybersecurity as the top threat to businesses over the last decade. The sixth global installment of KPMG’s annual Cybersecurity Considerations report examines current and emerging obstacles that organisations are facing across various industries – and eight key cybersecurity considerations they should focus on as the rapid pace of change accelerates in today’s dynamic environment.The KPMG annual Cybersecurity considerations report identifies eight key considerations that CISOs should prioritise in 2024 to help mitigate risk, drive business growth and build resilience. Explore the eight key cyber considerations and uncover the key actions organisations can take as they seek to accelerate recovery times, reduce the impact of incidents on employees, customers, and partners and aim to ensure their security plans enable — rather than expose — the business. Modern, robust cybersecurity has become a key requirement for success as threats and costly attacks proliferate. Today’s CISOs should embrace modern digital capabilities that can help them navigate emerging complexities and maintain a resilient future. In an AI-dominated business environment, the foundational principles of cybersecurity are even more critical. What CISOs and their teams focus on, and how they interact with the rest of the organisation is fluid, as the cybersecurity function becomes more broadly embedded within and better understood across the organisation. As organisations continue to transform their business models in the face of new digital disruptions, many are experiencing real challenges around workload, which is exacerbating the long-discussed cyber skills gap. AI and automation can help, but there is an underlying risk of talent attrition as many teams struggle to cope. AI is here to stay and has a place in virtually every organisational function, but there are a number of key cyber and privacy challenges that have the potential to affect the adoption and deployment of AI. Many factors appear to be contributing to the buzz around AI adoption, from a lack of training to the fear of missing out and possibly falling behind. A key challenge is weighing the potential benefits of integrating AI into cyber and privacy functions against the potential risks. Increasingly, many global organisations are looking to reduce the complexity and cost of their technology. Organisations that choose to do so by consolidating tools and services on to a single, or a limited number of platforms should seek to identify and navigate the inherent risks. Although there are several initiatives around digital identity sprouting up worldwide, interoperability between systems and enhanced authentication due to the emergence of deepfakes remain challenging, whether because of regulations, risk appetite, and/or public opinion regarding the processing of personal and biometric data. The rise of smart devices and products worldwide is challenging and changing traditional views and approaches toward security, prompting many regulators to introduce new regimes to ensure these products meet basic security requirements. Organisations should find a way, from the CISO on down, to create a broad, holistic culture of resilient security throughout their enterprise and with the aim of ensuring all stakeholders are on the same page.

Dive deep into the financial crime avenues and stay up-to-date with Indian and global regulatory initiatives Share Financial crimes have become an ever-evolving problem. Methods of perpetrating such crimes are going beyond traditional avenues and increasing in sophistication and technological integration, posing new challenges for financial institutions (FIs). Around USD3.1 trillion in illicit funds and USD485.6 billion in fraud scams and bank fraud schemes is estimated to have happened in 2023 alone with technology playing a major role in helping such crimes. In 2024, we saw some major regulatory initiatives/enactments with the U.S.A. enacting the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), while the European Union introduced the AML Package, including the establishment of the Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA), a new 6th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, and updated Transfer of Funds Regulations (TFRs) for crypto asset transfers. The U.K. has rolled out the Economic Crime Plan 2 (ECP2) and the G7 countries are working on AI regulations to combat financial crimes more effectively. Corporate Transparency Act (CTA)2 Effective 1 January 2024, The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has started accepting beneficial ownership information reports under the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA). Existing companies must file by 1 January 2025, while new companies have 90 days from creation or registration to file beneficial ownership information such as name, date of birth, address, and identification number. DOJ AML Policy Initiatives3 On 15 April 2024, the Department of Justice has introduced a pilot programme offering non-prosecution agreements (NPAs) to individuals who voluntarily disclose original information about corporate and white-collar crimes. The programme incentivises reporting by providing immunity in exchange for cooperation, including full disclosure, assistance in investigations, and restitution for disclosures made on or after 15 April 2024. Amended Money Laundering Regulations4 The Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Regulations 2023, effective 10 January 2024 introduced effectively differentiating between domestic and non-domestic PEPs with Domestic PEPs / associates being considered low risk thus requiring less stringent diligence measures. Failure to Prevent Fraud5 The UK government has published guidance on the new corporate criminal offence of 'failure to prevent fraud,' effective from 1 September 2025. This offence, part of the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act, holds large organisations accountable if they profit from fraud committed by employees or associates. Organisations must demonstrate reasonable fraud prevention measures to avoid liability. The guidance aims to foster an anti-fraud culture, similar to the impact of anti-bribery legislation. Developed with input from multiple agencies, it underscores the urgency for corporations to enhance their fraud prevention efforts. 6th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (6AMLD)6 On the mechanisms to be put in place by member states for the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, amending directives. The 6AMLD enhances mechanisms to prevent the use of the financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing. It includes stricter rules on beneficial ownership transparency and harmonizes AML measures across member states and became effective on 9 July 2024. Harmonisation of AML Rules7 The EU Council and Parliament agreed on a comprehensive AML package harmonising rules across the EU, expanding coverage to most of the crypto sector and luxury goods traders, introducing enhanced due diligence and a €10,000 cash payment limit, and strengthening beneficial ownership transparency and national AML systems. Authority for Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AMLA) will be based in Frankfurt and start operations in mid-2025. Detailed guideline for standardised test for the classification of crypto-assets8 The European Banking Authority released final guidelines on templates for explanations and opinions, and the standardised test for the classification of crypto-assets as per MiCAR guidelines (Article 97(1) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114). COSMIC Platform Launch9 On 1 April 2024, MAS launched COSMIC (Collaborative Sharing of Money Laundering/Terrorism Financing (ML/TF) Information & Cases), a digital platform for sharing information on potential financial crimes, with six major Singaporean banks. COSMIC helps detect and deter criminal activity by focusing on misuse of legal persons, misuse of trade finance, and proliferation financing. COSMIC allows FIs to securely share with one another, information on customers who exhibit multiple “red flags” that may indicate potential financial crime concerns, if stipulated thresholds are met. This makes it easier for FIs to detect and thereby deter criminal activity. Payment Services Act Amendments10 On 2 April 2024, MAS introduced amendments to the Payment Services Act to expand the scope of regulated payment services and impose new requirements on digital payment token (DPT) service providers. These include custodial services for DPTs, transmission and exchange facilitation, and cross-border money transfers. MAS will enforce anti-money laundering, user protection, and financial stability measures. Transitional arrangements are provided for entities to comply with the new regulations, which include safeguarding customer assets in trust accounts. Virtual Asset Risk Assessment Report11 MAS released its first Virtual Assets Risk Assessment Report. It provides a targeted review of the money laundering (ML), terrorism financing (TF) and proliferation financing (PF) risks associated with virtual assets, and complements Singapore’s national ML, TF and PF risk assessments. The VA RA identifies the key threats and vulnerabilities Singapore is exposed to. It also outlines relevant mitigation measures that government agencies and the private sector have put in place to mitigate the ML, TF and PF risks arising from virtual assets. National Strategy for AML/CFT12 On 2 September 2024, the UAE unveiled its 2024-27 National Strategy for AML/CFT/CPF, focusing on 11 strategic goals supported by legislative actions and regulatory reforms. The strategy emphasises risk-based compliance, effectiveness, and sustainability, aiming to enhance national and international coordination, supervision, and detection of illicit activities. It addresses emerging risks, including virtual assets and cybercrime, and aligns with international standards. Collaboration between SCA and VARA (UAE) for regulating Virtual Assets and Crypto Currencies13 The SCA and VARA have signed a cooperation agreement to strengthen the UAE's position as a global hub for virtual assets on 2 September 2024. Under the agreement, the SCA and VARA will set forth rules and procedures for licensing and supervision VASPs and any related activities, services or associated transactions. The agreement also includes mutual supervision, information exchange, and employee training initiatives. AML/CTF Act Amendments by AUSTRAC14 AUSTRAC passed an AML/CTF Amendment Bill 2024, which modernises and expands the AML/CTF regime to include high-risk services by lawyers, accountants, and other professionals. The bill aims to simplify compliance, reduce regulatory burdens, and enhance the detection and disruption of financial crimes. The bill's role in closing gaps and improving financial intelligence collection. AML (Anti Money Laundering) Compliance for Securities Market15 On 6 June 2024, SEBI updated AML compliance requirements for securities market intermediaries, including enhanced due diligence and transaction monitoring. This aims to strengthen the integrity of the securities market and prevent financial crimes. Internal Risk Assessment guidance for money laundering/terrorist financing risks16 The Reserve Bank of India issued comprehensive guidelines on 10 October 2024, for internal risk assessments by banks, NBFCs, and regulated entities to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing. These guidelines aim to streamline the AML/TF risk assessment process, enhance operational efficiency, and align with global standards. They address sector-specific risks and provide a detailed methodology for risk identification. This move equips financial institutions to manage current and future financial crime challenges effectively. Fraud Risk Management in Commercial Banks (including Regional Rural Banks) and All India Financial Institutions17 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued the Master Directions on Fraud Risk Management in Commercial Banks (including Regional Rural Banks) and All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs) on 15 July 2024. These directions aim to provide a robust framework for the prevention, early detection, and timely reporting of frauds You may refer our analysis of the said Master Directions by clicking here. Brokers' institutional mechanism for prevention and detection of fraud or market abuse18 On 4 July 2024, SEBI introduced measures focusing on brokers' institutional mechanisms for the prevention and detection of fraud or market abuse like surveillance systems, employee obligations, escalation and reporting mechanisms, whistleblower policy, implementation standards, and compliance timeline as these provisions will be phased on broker size, with effective dates ranging from 1 January 2025, to 1 April 2026. We are already witnessing changes in the Financial Services landscape as result of Web 3.0 and digital payment advancements streamlining transactions. Such changes also provide fraudsters / criminals with advanced tools for more effective scams. Such evolutions in technology offers new avenues for deceptive tactics, from phishing scams utilising artificial intelligence to complex hacking methods that exploit blockchain vulnerabilities. Generative AI fraud has emerged as a significant threat to financial institutions. Criminals are increasingly leveraging AI to create deepfakes and synthetic identities, manipulate audio/video for identity theft, and clone voices to bypass biometrics. Robust AI-based counter analytics are needed to combat these advanced tactics effectively. Cryptocurrency fraud poses significant challenges to financial institutions. Criminals use tools to create fake cryptocurrencies, deepfake exchanges, and sophisticated phishing schemes. Fake exchanges are available as Fraud-as-a-Service (FaaS), facilitating large-scale thefts and manipulation of digital assets. The decentralised nature of crypto exchanges makes it difficult to monitor and detect fraudulent transactions effectively. The surge in QR code usage has led to increased exploitation by scammers. These scams often involve tampering with legitimate QR codes to redirect payments to fraudulent accounts or phishing sites, causing significant financial losses. As QR codes become more widespread, these scams are expected to grow in sophistication. FaaS (Fraud-as-a-Service) is an emerging cybercrime model where criminals offer services, tools, and expertise to low-tech fraudsters. Available on dark web marketplaces, these aids range from phishing kits and captcha readers to advanced tools for account takeovers, money laundering (as a service to hide fraud proceeds), synthetic identities (by filing returns, maintaining bank accounts, etc.), and ID databases (used by hackers to return favourable API results). The financial crime landscape will continue to evolve, and staying ahead requires a proactive approach, leveraging the latest technologies and consistently updating strategies. It’s an arms race, but with the right tool and knowledge, FIs can effectively combat these emerging threats. In times to come, it is expected that regulatory changes will continue encompass and embrace the challenges posed by such emerging technologies.

Tech: A bold sector that innovates while leading by example Share key markets USD+ in revenue The digital transformation journey is an important strategic consideration for all sectors, but none more so than the technology sector. This means it has to do two things simultaneously: lead by example and rethink its own strategies. As tech innovation offers almost endless potential, many tech leaders are afraid of falling behind. This can lead to the temptation to make hurried decisions, which may prove misguided, risky and expensive. In “KPMG global tech report: Technology insights,” our insights show that much of the tech sector’s digital transformation success is a result of discipline and targeted investments. Through strategic spending decisions, such as prioritizing AI and environmental, social and governance (ESG) activities, the industry has become skilled at protecting its transformation progress from volatility. Three-quarters (76 percent) of tech executives say their total cost of ownership and cost-benefit-analysis forecasts are usually accurate. The same proportion say they run calculations to forecast the potential value of the technology before investing, which is slightly above the cross-sector average. Tech is one of the sectors in our survey that is most likely to prioritize technology investments based on employee feedback, with a five percentage point lead over the global average. 73 percent of tech executives say their workforce leverages its organization’s tech investments so they target their sustainability and social goals, which slightly higher than the cross-sector average. Most sectors are working toward a centralized approach to AI implementation. But the tech industry plans to continue developing AI governance policies and democratizing its approach to AI experimentation as it builds more experience in that area.

It’s exposing them to new risks. It is also creating countless opportunities to improve operations and efficiencies, unlock value and grow competitive advantage Share Cyber Human Risk Management (HRM) is essential to cybersecurity culture, as the way people manage technology is the window through which threat actors can infiltrate organizations. In all organizations, but particularly ones with diverse ways of working across geographies, building a comprehensive and sustained cybersecurity culture can be challenging. Cybersecurity culture complexities can include how to overcome change resistance, how to adopt emerging technologies securely without slowing down innovation, how to manage interconnected systems securely, how to make the most of metrics and measurement, and more. KPMG, along with Cybersecurity at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Sloan (CAMS), part of Sloan Management School Cybersecurity Research Division, set out to gain a better understanding of cybersecurity culture, its challenges, and how AI could make an impact. Read the full survey findings to learn how AI can impact cybersecurity culture. Secure behaviors Fostering a cybersecurity culture – the values, attitudes and beliefs at leadership, group and individual levels across the enterprise - is key to managing cyber risk and driving secure behaviors. Current state of maturity With five levels of cybersecurity culture maturity, the organizations surveyed for this report are early in their cybersecurity journey and more so when it comes to using AI to support it. Confronting cyber culture challenges Organizations are facing a variety of challenges on the way to building a robust cybersecurity culture. Of these challenges, four overarching themes can be seen: the human behavior factor, emerging technologies, interconnected systems and measuring culture. Fostering a strong cybersecurity culture across enterprises and broader ecosystems clearly has its challenges. And, it’s only getting more challenging. AI supports can help an organization building a strong cybersecurity culture through five key themes – visibility, efficiency, quantification, personalization and scalability. Scenario: CISO Yuki, as she prepares her annual budget, asks her Cyber HRM Director for help to refine the organization’s awareness and training strategy and include KPIs for board-level reporting. AI use case: Using AI, the HRM Director aggregates data from internal and external sources to deliver a targeted risk analysis, tailored training and awareness strategy, and a scorecard that links cyber initiatives to business outcomes. Benefits: This AI-driven approach equips Yuki with clear, data-backed insights for resource allocation, while allowing the HRM Director to maintain operational focus. Discover more practical scenarios to help you overcome common challenges when starting to use AI to improve your cybersecurity culture. Build a stronger cybersecurity culture with the support of AI by considering the following: 1. Outline your aspirations: Understand your current cybersecurity culture and set goals and aspirations for where you want to be in the future. 2. Secure support and investment: Seek support from parts of the organization that already have capabilities to develop and embed AI across functions. 3. Explore and experiment: Identify the gaps in your current capabilities and explore options for using AI through the definition of use cases. 4. Prioritize and implement: Focus on implementing the AI use cases that can have the most impact to driving a stronger cybersecurity culture and reducing risk. 5. Collect and measure what matters: An upfront focus on data and its quality can help you get the best out of your AI use cases, and avoid accuracy impacts of your AI models. 6. Be mindful of new risks: Consider what the AI tools and technologies can and can’t do, and the risks that come with them. 7. Prioritize the employee change journey: Prioritize employee wellbeing throughout change with the right communications, training and recognition.

KPMG in India and AIMA’s MCDI 2024 survey report highlights the urgent need for resilient, empathetic, and future-ready leadership in India Share KPMG in India, in collaboration with the All India Management Association (AIMA), has released the ‘Management Capability Development Index (MCDI) India 2024 report’ at AIMA’s 10th National Leadership Conclave. The report offers a deep dive into how leaders and managers across sectors perceive their management capabilities, benchmark practices, and prioritise future growth areas. Against a backdrop of geopolitical shifts, environmental concerns, and rapid technological disruption, it highlights the urgent need for resilient, empathetic, and future-ready leadership in India. Now in its seventh edition, the MCDI survey draws insights from 200 senior leaders, including CEOs, CXOs, and other top executives across industries. It assesses organisational maturity across ten dimensions such as visionary leadership, performance leadership, people leadership and self-development, integrity and corporate governance, and focus on results. Participants rated the urgency and impact of each capability, providing a rich dataset segmented by demographics. The findings offer a valuable benchmark for organisations looking to build competitive leadership capabilities in a fast-evolving environment. MCDI score slipped by ~8.3% since 2011, from around 76 to 69.7 in 2024, reflecting stagnant growth in management capabilities. Integrity and corporate governance maintained the highest ranking across a decade, showing no major decline and reflecting stable ethical leadership focus. Focus on getting results pulls off a stunning turnaround — from the worst-rated in 2014 to leading the charts in 2024, thanks to a growing results-driven mindset across Indian enterprises. Innovation and adaptability became the lowest performing dimension in 2024, a worrying fall of approximately 10% since 2011. External relationships, financial leadership, and integrity and corporate governance scores declined year-on-year from 2022, signaling emerging concerns around adaptability and forward-planning. Core capabilities like organisation capability and application of technology and knowledge show only modest improvements over the years, hinting at deeper systemic gaps. Champion the adoption of AI, IoT, and blockchain technologies while embedding ethics, transparency, and sustainability at the core of digital strategies to stay competitive and responsible. Foster inclusive, empathetic leadership that prioritises emotional intelligence, continuous learning, and employee well-being to create high-performing, future-ready teams. Adapt to shifting work models by offering a compelling employee experience, balancing flexibility with meaningful in-office engagement to attract and retain top talent. Integrate financial planning with broader organisational impact goals, while strengthening risk management frameworks to navigate economic uncertainties effectively. Promote cross-functional collaboration, encourage experimentation, and empower employees to drive continuous innovation and adapt swiftly to changing market needs. Mitigate risks by conducting regular audits, investing in employee compliance training, enhancing data governance practices, and using technology for proactive monitoring. This comprehensive report by AIMA and KPMG in India serves as a valuable resource for organisations seeking to build a more inclusive and gender-balanced leadership pipeline.

This ongoing development,\nwith a clean slate of paper and then reimagine the where an initial sense of self-doubt gives way to\nworld. Yet creating a reimagined world is conviction and confidence, creates a pipeline of\nimpossible without a route map; this is where leaders.\nstrategic leadership comes in.\nAs Jack Welch has observed: “Before you are a\nWhen leaders craft a vision for the future, they leader, success is all about growing yourself. When\nmust also be able to pick people, motivate them, you become a leader, success is all about growing\nand make sure they have the capacity to actualise others.\" This is perhaps the best way to summarise\nthe vision, knowing well that framing a vision itself the journey towards visionary and strategic\nis fraught with risk. Sometimes, the way middle leadership.\nmanagement and frontline managers perceive the\nvision might be different from the picture that\nleaders have in mind. The efficacy of visionary and\nforward-thinking leadership thus depends on the\nleader or leadership group’s ability to articulate a\ncohesive vision that creates alignment, empathy,\nownership, and association across the hierarchy.\nFor this to happen meaningfully, there is a need for\na professional and proactive culture that makes it\npossible to anticipate potential challenges and\nsteer teams toward shared objectives. It is also\nuseful to develop an environment that\naccommodates different leadership styles,\nstrengthens problem-solving, fosters innovation,\nenhances creativity, and encourages calculated risk\ntaking. The last aspect is especially important since\neffective leadership is about boldness and\ndecisiveness.\nAt the same time, the vision should not be\nunicentric. Placing excessive emphasis on a\nleader’s vision makes it difficult to explore\npotentially valuable alternative ideas. This leads to\na lack of objectivity, especially when the current\nvision needs to be refined or replaced with a more\neffective one for a given environment.\nA second challenge relates to sustaining\nmomentum. While visionary leaders excel at\ninspiring teams, maintaining impetus may\nsometimes be challenging due to inconsistent\nfollow-through. The obsession of certain leaders\nabout the future might lead them to overlook\noperational challenges or opportunities that exist in\nthe near term. The longevity of the vision could\nalso suffer if it relies heavily on a leader’s\nindividual traits and if there isn’t a robust\nsuccession plan in place.\nSome of these shortcomings can be overcome by\ncertain exemplary leaders who are able to inspire\nand instil confidence about achieving goals and\nSunil Kant Munjal\nfulfilling aspirational targets; by shadowing,\nobserving, and learning from such leaders, Chairman,\nindividuals can integrate similar traits into their Hero Enterprise\n©© 22002255 KKPPMMGG AAssssuurraannccee aanndd CCoonnssuullttiinngg SSeerrvviicceess LLLLPP,, aann IInnddiiaann LLiimmiitteedd LLiiaabbiilliittyy PPaarrttnneerrsshhiipp aanndd aa mmeemmbbeerr ffiirrmm ooff tthhee KKPPMMGG gglloobbaall oorrggaanniizzaattiioonn ooff iinnddeeppeennddeenntt\nmmeemmbbeerr ffiirrmmss aaffffiilliiaatteedd wwiitthh KKPPMMGG IInntteerrnnaattiioonnaall LLiimmiitteedd,, aa pprriivvaattee EEnngglliisshh ccoommppaannyy lliimmiitteedd bbyy gguuaarraanntteeee..

The confidence of CEOs in India in terms of growth prospects for the global economy over the next three years has considerably increased to 80 per cent in 2024 from 69 per cent in 2023.

This indicates while overall economic recovery continues, executives remain cautious due to lingering uncertainties stemming from geopolitical complexities, economic instability, and rapid technological advancements. The confidence of CEOs in India and globally in growth prospects for the country remains unchanged in 2024 from 2023 levels. This stability supports business confidence of CEOs in India and globally to pursue both organic and inorganic growth opportunities. Confidence levels in growth prospects While external threats like geopolitical tensions and political instability have receded, CEOs now face a new set of internal challenges, including operational difficulties with the constant emergence of new and disruptive technologies. The evolving risk landscape has also shifted the perception of CEOs, with 16 per cent CEOs in India (in comparison to 10 per cent of CEOs in India in 2023) and 14 per cent CEOs globally considering operational issues as the greatest threat to their organisations' growth.

CEOs in India believe that generative AI will increasingly be utilised to drive productivity gains and value creation across the workforce, with 18 percent CEOs in India compared to 16 per cent CEOs globally agreeing with the statement. Additional key benefits that CEOs in India view as major advantage of implementing generative AI technologies include, new product and market growth opportunities (12 per cent), fraud detection and cyber-attack response (12 per cent), increased profitability (12 per cent), increased innovation (11 per cent), and upskilling the workforce for future readiness (11 per cent). 71 per cent CEOs in India compared to 76 per cent CEOs globally report having a solid understanding of the ways in which generative AI can enhance their organisations' performance and secure a competitive edge. At the same time, they are also apprehensive about the pace of progress on generative AI regulations, with 77 percent of CEOs in India as opposed to 69 per cent globally agreeing with this sentiment. Comparison of CEOs in India and globally on their plans to invest in generative AI Comparison of CEOs in India and globally on time taken to see a return on investment in implementation of generative AI CEOs in India find are finding themselves at crossroads, grappling with the challenge of deploying AI to drive growth and shareholder return, while ensuring that the ethical human impact of the technology is not compromised. Therefore, ethical challenges are a major concern, with 64 percent CEOs in India compared to 61 percent CEOs globally tagging it as a significant obstacle to adopting generative AI in their organisations'. CEOs exhibit a neutral stance regarding their readiness to implement generative AI, especially when it comes to data security. 56 percent CEOs in India compared to 58 percent of global CEOs cited that they neither agree or disagree that they are confident of being data ready to deploy generative AI safely and efficiently. Half of the surveyed CEOs in India and around 56 percent of the CEOs globally neither agree nor disagree that their employees possess the right skills to fully leverage the benefits of generative AI, while 86 percent CEOs in India compared to 76 percent of the CEOs globally believe that generative AI will not impact the number of jobs, but will require upskilling and existing resources to be redeployed. Moreover, 66 percent CEOs in India compared to 58 percent CEOs globally concur that the integration of generative AI has necessitated a reassessment of the skills required for entry-level roles. Comparison of CEOs in India and globally anticipating the impact of generative AI CEOs in India are increasing investment in cybersecurity to protect their organisations' from potential threats posed by AI. Around 58 percent of the CEOs in India compared to 55 percent CEOs globally expressed confidence that their company's cybersecurity measures are capable of keeping pace with the rapid AI advancements. However, around 49 per cent CEOs in India compared to 59 percent of CEOs globally were uncertain about their organisations' capacity to secure suitable cybersecurity talent and solutions to defend against AI threats. Manish Choksi Non-Executive Vice Chairman, Asian Paints Sunit Sinha Partner and Head- Human Capital Advisory Solutions, Business Consulting In the face of shifting workforce dynamics and challenges posed by both internal and external factors, growth-focused business leaders are recalibrating their social contracts to meet the changing expectations of current and future talent, while keeping long-term organisational growth in mind. According to the KPMG 2024 CEO Outlook survey, CEOs in India are taking a firm stance on returning to pre-pandemic, in-office work models. 78 per cent CEOs in India, compared to 83 per cent CEOs globally, envision a return to an in-office working environment for their employees within the next three years. To facilitate this, 91 per cent of CEOs in India compared to 87 per cent CEOs globally are prepared to reward employees who consistently come into the office with promotions, raises, and more favorable assignments. In 2024, 22 per cent of CEOs in India, compared to 20 per cent in 2023, have emphasized that enhancing the employee value proposition to attract and retain top talent will be their primary operational priority for achieving long-term growth objectives. This trend underscores the commitment of CEOs in India and around the world to support a smooth transition back to traditional work models, ensuring seamless integration for their employees while aligning with their growth strategies. Comparison on the working environment for corporate employees in the next three years basis views shared by CEOs in India 59 per cent of the CEOs globally are focusing on investing in new technologies and only 41 per cent are placing more capital investment in developing their workforce's skills and capabilities to drive growth and transformation within their organisations’. On the contrary, CEOs in India are equally emphasising on the importance of developing workforce skills and capabilities alongside technological investments. The KPMG 2024 CEO Outlook survey indicates that 83 per cent CEOs in India perceive labor market shifts, particularly an aging workforce, as having a moderate impact on their organisations' employee recruitment, retention, and overall culture. Conversely, only 64 per cent of CEOs globally share this view, with 13 per cent believing the impact will be minimal. Prashant Kumar MD and CEO Yes Bank Namrata Rana National Head of ESG CEOs have started considering ESG as an integral part of their corporate strategy, particularly in the context of enhancing customer relationships and bolstering brand reputation. 30 percent of CEOs in India compared to 34 percent globally have cited building customer relationships and positive brand association as the top area where ESG would have the most impact, followed by shaping capital allocation, partnerships, alliances and M&A strategy, and attracting next generation of talent. Further, it is evident that leaders are prepared to undertake measures in response to ESG concerns. A significant majority, 66 percent of CEOs in India compared to 76 percent CEOs globally, have indicated they would be willing to divest a profitable part of the business that was damaging their reputation. More than half of the CEOs in India (54 per cent) compared to CEOs globally (60 per cent) agree that there is strong public expectation on businesses to address societal challenges, including inclusion, diversity, equity, social justice and climate change. However, there remains a degree of uncertainty among CEOs regarding their ability to achieve their Net Zero objectives by 2030. A mere 36 percent of CEOs in India compared to 51 percent of CEOs globally concur that they possess the confidence to meet these goals. CEOs in India ( 56 per cent) as well as globally (55 per cent) perceive that their stakeholders' expectations with regard to ESG change faster than they are able to adapt their strategy, which is a major obstacle in achieving their ESG objectives. Six areas where ESG strategy would have the greatest impact over the next three years in India as well as globally. There is a noticeable increase in the politicisation and polarisation of critical issues, including social mobility and climate change, which is presenting significant challenges for CEOs in India as well as globally who are already facing the pressure to meet or re-evaluate their established targets. As a result, CEOs both India and global are altering their approach to communicating their efforts on ESG initiatives, with 75 per cent of CEOs in India compared to 69 per cent CEOs globally concurring with the statement. On the other hand, 19 per cent of the CEOs in India compared to 28 per cent of their global counterparts have agreed that they have evolved their ESG strategies in the past 12 months to meet the changing needs of the stakeholders.

On the contrary, CEOs in India are equally emphasising on the importance of developing\nworkforce skills and capabilities alongside technological investments.\nThe KPMG 2024 CEO Outlook survey indicates that 83 per cent CEOs in India perceive labour market shifts, particularly an aging workforce, as having a moderate impact on\ntheir organisations' employee recruitment, retention, and overall culture.

Further, 30 per cent CEOs in India compared to 31 per cent of CEOs globally recognise that the number of employees retiring coupled with a lack of skilled\nworkers to replace them as the most significant challenge facing their companies. Additionally, CEOs in India as well as globally identify the widening expectation gap between\nolder employees and younger generations, along with knowledge transfer issues, as critical factors influencing their organisations’.\nMoving on, both CEOs in India and globally are optimistic about the potential of generative AI to enhance workforce skills and readiness for future challenges.

Additionally, 60 per cent of CEOs in India\ncompared to 69 per cent of CEOs globally consider that experimentation is key to fully unlocking generative AI's potential and all employees should be encouraged to take\npart, regardless of their background or level of seniority.\nWe view generative AI as a strategic enabler that complements human talent, rather than a disruptor. The\nfact that 86% of Indian CEOs see AI as a redeployment opportunity resonates with our approach—we are\nactively integrating AI to enhance customer experience, streamline operations, and improve decision-\nmaking.

This phased approach provides a structured roadmap, helping retail prioritize investments, align initiatives with business goals, and position themselves effectively in the age of AI in retail. The Enable phase focuses on enabling people and building AI foundations. Organisations appoint a responsible executive, create an AI strategy, identify high-value use cases, boost AI literacy, align with regulations and establish ethical guardrails. AI pilots are launched across functions, while cloud platforms and pre-trained models are leveraged with minimal customisation. The Embed phase integrates AI into workflows, products, services, value streams, robotics, and wearables, delivering greater value. A senior leader drives enterprise-wide workforce redesign, re-skilling and change, embedding AI into operating models with a focus on ethics, trust and security. AI agents and diverse models are deployed, supported by cloud and legacy tech modernisation, while enterprise-wide data enhances operations. The Evolve phase evolves business models and ecosystems, using AI and frontier technologies like quantum computing and blockchain to solve large sector-wide challenges. AI orchestrates seamless value across enterprises and partners.

Share State Road Development Corporation Address critical challenges in traffic management on its expressways KPMG in India successfully turned a bold vision into operational reality, delivering an effective and efficient service The expressway network faced severe traffic congestion, frequent accidents, and low adherence to traffic regulations, resulting in high fatalities and traffic-related issues. The challenge was to develop a thorough approach that could not only manage and reduce congestion but also enhance road safety and compliance with traffic rules. KPMG in India was engaged to design and implement a cutting-edge Highway Traffic Management System (HTMS), one of the leading initiative under a Public-Private Partnership model. The HTMS project leveraged advanced artificial intelligence technologies to tackle the client’s challenges effectively. Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology was implemented to identify blacklisted vehicles, while surveillance systems played a critical role in crime detection. Mobile surveillance vans equipped with speed guns and pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras assisted in continuous monitoring and enforcement. The system incorporated sophisticated technology to detect a total of 17 types of traffic violations, including speeding, lane violations, and mobile phone usage while driving. It utilised 4D radar and AI-based video analytics to assisted in precise detection and enforcement of traffic rules. The HTMS included an incident and accident detection system, which helped in swiftly addressing emergencies and improving overall road safety. This integration led to faster deployment of emergency services like fire engines, ambulances and automated alerts to the law enforcement agencies for better management of unforeseen incidents. At the core of the HTMS was a centralised command and control center, which played a crucial role in managing the system. This center facilitated real-time monitoring of incidents such as heavy rains and landslides and streamlined the emergency response process, significantly reducing response times. The HTMS system was developed to monitor various parameters including traffic violations, weather conditions, and real-time traffic updates. This was achieved through a range of technologies such as Dynamic tvlessage Signboards, kiosks for information and making payments for traffic challans and mobile applications for providing timely informution to drivers. The installation of speed detection systems and AI-based video analytics for traffic rule enforcement led to a notable reduction in fatal accidents on the expressway. Variable Messaging Sign Boards at 22 strategic locations provided motorists with real-time updates on traffic conditions, road closures, and weather, improving overall driver awareness and safety. Emergency vehicles, including towing vans, cranes, and ambulances, were equipped with vehicle tracking systems. This integration allowed for quicker detection of accidents and broken-down vehicles through the incident detection system, effectively halving the response time. Through these achievements, KPMG in India demonstrated its capability as a trusted ally in accomplishing successful outcomes and setting new benchmarks in traffic management and road safety.

Share The energy industry is at a pivotal moment of transformation, balancing the shift to renewables with the critical need for energy security. As global companies navigate this evolution, the question arises: How can energy firms use cutting-edge technology to overcome complex challenges and gain a competitive edge? Navigating today’s energy landscape requires more than just keeping pace with technological change—it demands a strategic approach to help ensure every tech innovation delivers real value. The challenge lies in cutting through the hype to make evidence-based decisions that foster resilience, efficiency, and growth. For energy companies, scaling tools like AI and advanced analytics must be done with a focus on safety, responsibility, and measurable impact. The energy view of the KPMG global tech report offers a unique lens into how technology leaders across energy, natural resources and chemicals are achieving this delicate balance.

Share Industrial manufacturing technology leaders key markets USD+ in revenue In the rapidly evolving landscape of industrial manufacturing (IM), organizations are increasingly recognizing the imperative of digital transformation to enhance operational efficiency, quality control, and sustainability. The KPMG global tech report highlights that industrial manufacturing firms are at the forefront of this transformation, showcasing the highest levels of digital maturity across various technology categories compared to other sectors. This report serves as a critical resource for understanding the current state of digital adoption in industrial manufacturing and the strategic steps necessary for continued advancement. The KPMG research surveyed 2,450 executives from 26 countries and jurisdictions, including 368 leaders from industrial manufacturing. The findings reveal that 76% of IM firms express a strong willingness to embrace cutting- edge technology and the sector excels in AI adoption with 34% of organizations achieving a return on investment (ROI) from multiple AI use cases. However, the report also identifies significant maturity gaps in areas such as supply chain, procurement, and finance functions, which hinder the full realization of digital potential. Multiple recommendations emerge from the report including enhancing data strategies to help ensure seamless integration and analysis across disparate systems, upskilling the workforce and prioritizing the development of robust cybersecurity measures. Interoperability, hybrid models and AI innovation are the battlegrounds for digital excellence Out of the eight sectors polled, manufacturing organizations are most likely to be in the highest stage of strategic maturity in the majority of the nine tech categories measured. And 76 percent of industrial manufacturing firms say their workforce has an appetite to embrace cutting-edge technology — the highest proportion of all sectors surveyed. Manufacturing is one of the three sectors where organizations are most likely to be at the most mature phase of AI adoption, with 34 percent already achieving return on investment (ROI) in several AI use cases. Industrial manufacturing performs above the cross-sector average in the number of its organizations that are in our top two levels of data maturity. The KPMG global tech report 2024 surveyed 2,450 technology leaders from 26 countries across 8 industries: financial services, tech, retail and consumer packaged goods, industrial manufacturing, life sciences and pharmaceuticals, healthcare, government and public sector, and energy. Survey respondents represented organizations with annual revenues above US$100 million and included a diverse group of technology leaders, such as chief digital officers, CIOs, CTOs, CISOs, chief AI officers, and others. A significant proportion of the respondent sample comprised senior leaders: 50 percent were board members or members of the C-suite, 15 percent held director or senior manager-level positions. The industrial manufacturing perspective of the KPMG global tech report 2024 draws on the views of 368 industrial manufacturing technology leaders.

In the race to keep up with rapid tech innovation, there’s a need to carefully balance speed, security and value, to seize opportunities and drive sustainable value, while avoiding costly mistakes Share There needs to be a balance between keeping up, and applying a strategic approach to extracting genuine value from tech. It’s essential to navigate the hype through evidence-based decisions, deliver solutions that are resilient, and when scaling new tools such as AI, to do this safely and responsibly. This year, the KPMG global tech report 2024 – Beyond the hype: balancing speed, security and value, researched how tech execs are achieving this mix. The report harnesses insights from 2,450 tech professionals from 26 countries and 8 industries, from organizations valued at US $100 million and over. Read the full report to find out what tech execs are thinking and planning. With the relentless pace of change and the fear of missing out (FOMO), decision makers need to resist the hype and pursue a measured, strategic approach to investment. Make value-driven decisions with traceability and evidence, by incorporating insights from stakeholders, customers, employees and partners, while adopting an always-on approach to performance management, to help optimize value with confidence. Data capabilities are maturing, but unlocking more value from tech requires repositioning them as a core competency for the organization, backed up by security and governance. Many organizations are starting to reap rewards from AI, but generating value at scale remains a challenge. While a desire to progress and outpace your competition is healthy, do not let this boil over and distort your judgment. Rather than blindly following the herd, anchor decisions in your organization’s strategic objectives and look for tangible primary evidence of the right path to take. ­Align stakeholders around a clear definition of success that cascades into a set of tangible metrics. Adopt an “always-on” approach to performance management and continuously monitor and adjust metrics in accordance with internal and external changes. These steps can help the organization to confidently make decisions and deliver the value promised. Embrace structured technical debt management. Establish clear remediation plans and robust architecture principles to contain and rationalize the technology landscape. Innovation is not restricted to new technology. Explore new ways to collaborate, co-invest and share risk with your chosen partners. Use their networks to gain access to the latest technology and inventive ideas from around the globe. Strive to ensure solutions are secure by design and embed trust and security assurance from the outset. Design, build, deploy and use AI and emerging tech solutions in a responsible and ethical manner so your organization can accelerate value with confidence. Establish a robust data management framework that combines data, people, processes and policies to help ensure information is reliable, relevant and appropriately used. Drive a shared understanding across the organization of how to harness data more effectively to support rapid and informed decision-making. Test your workforce competence and sentiment on AI, and use this to determine the best way to bridge knowledge gaps, facilitate continuous learning and encourage cross-functional collaboration. Drawing on KPMG professionals’ experience and the findings of this new research of 2,450 tech execs from 26 countries and 8 industries, explores how high performers stand out in their tech investments. The KPMG suite of business transformation solutions help clients get to a more productive and sustainable future.

If third parties misuse or mishandle personal data, it can lead to\nfines, legal action, and a loss of consumer trust\n• Data manipulation: Misrepresenting consumer demographics or interests by manipulating data is unethical\nand can lead to false advertising, flawed marketing strategies, and legal repercussions\n• Safety violations: Partnering with third parties that don’t meet safety standards can result in serious legal and\nreputational consequences, including lawsuits, regulatory fines, and public criticism\n• Sexual harassment: Allegations of sexual harassment against the key executives or owners of third parties\n• Political exposure: Association with political parties or government owned entities/agencies. Politically\nExposed Persons (PEPs), due to their influential positions, are more likely to be involved in corruption, bribery,\nand other financial crimes.\n© 2025 KPMG Assurance and Consulting Services LLP, an Indian Limited Liability Partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent\nmember firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee. All rights reserved.\n02 Legal risks\n• Litigation: Involvement of third parties in criminal and civil cases\n• Copyright infringement: In advertising, using copyrighted materials without due diligence can lead to lawsuits\nand costly legal battles, potentially halting campaigns, and damaging client relationships\n• Patent infringement – Patent infringement lawsuits can lead to costly settlements, licensing fees, and even\ncourt-mandated restrictions on the use of the infringing technology\n• Illegal outdoor advertising: Unauthorised billboards and failure to secure permits pose significant legal risks,\nincluding hefty fines and forced removal, as outdoor advertising is strictly regulated\n• Monopolistic actions: Companies that unfairly control pricing or suppress competition through dominant\nmarket positions face scrutiny under antitrust laws. Monopolising advertising platforms can result in legal\npenalties\n• Failure to return leased advertisement equipment - Failing to return leased advertisement equipment, such\nas digital billboards, projectors, or other advertising assets, after the lease term expires constitutes a breach of\ncontract.\n03 Regulatory risks\n• Anti-competitive practices – Practices like price-fixing, collusion, or market dominance abuse are strictly\nregulated by global antitrust laws. In advertising, this may involve competitors manipulating ad prices or\ncontrolling media access\n• Ethical concerns – Misleading advertisements, where companies make false claims about products or\nservices, raise significant ethical and regulatory issues. Regulatory bodies may impose fines, demand\ncorrective advertising, or even ban companies from advertising in severe cases\n• Misinformation and fake news - Companies promoting false or misleading content may face legal liabilities,\nlawsuits, and regulatory scrutiny. Stricter guidelines on content distribution mean non-compliance can lead to\nfinancial penalties, content bans, and reputational damage\n• Violation of data protection laws - Violating data protection laws poses major regulatory risks. In advertising,\nmisuse of personal data for targeted campaigns can lead to serious legal consequences\n• Tax evasion - Tax evasion presents serious regulatory and legal risks. Companies engaging in tax evasion not\nonly face financial penalties and criminal charges but also risk damaging their reputation with investors,\npartners, and consumers\n• Money laundering - Companies involved in or unaware of money laundering can incur hefty fines, lose\nbusiness licenses, and face criminal charges under anti-money laundering (AML) laws. Such associations can\nresult in reputational damage and increased regulatory scrutiny\n• Engaging with entities operating in sanctioned countries - Engaging in business with entities operating in\nsanctioned countries presents severe legal and financial risks. Violating international sanctions can lead to\nhefty fines, loss of business licenses, and restrictions on trade.\n04 Financial risks\n• Compliance issues - Non-filing of annual GST returns, PAN mismatch and potential identity issues\n• Vendors incurred losses - A company’s failure to meet financial commitments to vendors can result in legal\naction, supply chain disruptions, or increased costs as vendors may charge higher fees to mitigate their risk\n• Delayed remittance of outstanding dues - Failure to remit taxes on time can damage a company’s\nreputation, signalling poor financial management to investors, partners, and stakeholders\n• Credit defaults - Defaulting on credit can lead to severe financial consequences, including damage to the\ncompany’s credit rating, higher borrowing costs, legal action from creditors, and loss of access to financing\n• Insolvency and bankruptcy - Insolvency and bankruptcy pose significant risks to a company’s operations, as\nthey can result in the loss of assets, dissolution of the business, and legal disputes with creditors\n• Cases of dishonoured checks - A cheque bounce, or a dishonoured cheque, occurs when a cheque issued\nfor payment is returned by the bank due to insufficient funds, a mismatch in signature, or account closure.\nIt can lead to legal consequences under the Negotiable Instruments Act in many countries.\n© 2025 KPMG Assurance and Consulting Services LLP, an Indian Limited Liability Partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent\nmember firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Development of different ECL components\nIn general, different ECL frameworks (IFRS9, IndAS 109, ASC 326) are principal based and do not prescribe a\nsingle method that is to be used for ECL computation. As per ASC 326-20, “an entity may use discounted\ncash flow methods, loss-rate methods, roll-rate methods, probability-of-default methods, or methods that\nutilise an aging schedule to compute allowance for credit loss.2\nIn our experience, most common approach to compute ECL is based on PD, LGD and EAD estimation.\nUnder this approach, FIs can compute ECL basis below formula:\nT\nECL =  PD  LGD  EAD  D\nt t t t\nt=1\nWhere;\nPD is probability of default which defines the likelihood that the borrower will default on its obligations\nwhen they come due within specific time.\nLGD is loss given default which defines the amount that the FI will lose in case a borrower defaults on its\nobligations.\nEAD is exposure at default which defines the exposure that will be at risk in case a borrower defaults on\nits obligations. This will include principle outstanding, accrued interest and future interest that the FI is\nexpecting to receive during the lifetime of the contract.\nD is discount rate which can be computed as Effective Interest Rate (EIR) under GMM and Simplified\napproach or Credit-Adjusted Effective Interest Rate (CEIR) under POCI approach.\n2. \"Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” issued by the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (FASB) in June 2016.\n6 | Expected Credit Loss (ECL) Expected Credit Loss (ECL) | 6\nBelow we will discuss on different key components to be considered by FIs while computing ECL using this\nmethod:\n3.1 Definition of default\nFIs should have clear and consistent default In our view, FIs should assess different portfolios and\ndefinition. We have noted that many FIs do not either finalise definition of default.

An FI can use guidelines as issued by RBI\nas well as other regulators such as European\nBanking Authority (EBA) for this purpose.\nSome of the parameters that can be considered as\npart of default definition are listed below:\n1. Counterparty classified as NPA\n2. Exposure to counterparty is restructured or\nmodified due to financial difficulties\n3. Counterparty facing financial difficulty and is\nunlikely to pay which can be assessed basis\ndifferent parameters.\n3.2 Segmentation\nSegmentation or pooling refers to dividing the portfolio basis homogenous risk characteristics. All facilities\nshould have homogenous risks within a segment/pool and heterogenous risks between any two\nsegments/pools. Some of the parameters that can be considered for creating segments are:\nGeography such as base country or continent (India, Rest Asia, Europe), region (north,\n1.\nsouth, east, west), city (tier one, tier two, metro)\n2. Portfolio type such as corporate, NBFC, SME, retail, home loan, trade receivables\n3.

FIs should perform further quantitative and\nqualitative analysis basis different parameters to segment/pool the portfolio.\nExpected Credit Loss (ECL) | 7\n3.3 Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR)\nUnder ECL requirements, FIs will need to compute ECL for either next 12-month or for remaining lifetime\ndepending on the change in credit risk since initial recognition of the facility. FIs need to classify the facilities\nin either of the three stages as highlighted below:\nStage 1 – facilities which do not have significant increase in credit risk and thus 12-month ECL to be\ncomputed for such facilities\nStage 2 – facilities which have significant increase in credit risk and thus lifetime ECL to be computed\nfor such facilities\nStage 3 – facilities which are in default basis default definition or serving cool-off period.\nFIs can use different quantitative and qualitative should be decided. Additionally, FIs should identify\nparameters to assess change in credit risk.

It smoothens out the short-term\nfluctuations in the economic environment by considering a full business cycle, which includes\nperiods of both economic growth and recession\nPoint in Time (PiT) PD which estimates the probability of default based on the current\neconomic conditions and the borrower’s present financial health. It is more sensitive to the\nshort-term changes in the economy and the borrower’s situation.\nAs per regulatory requirement, FIs need to use PiT issues that we have noticed in the PD computation\nPD for ECL computation. FIs can compute either TTC which we think will not be in line with the industry\nPD and convert that to PiT PD with macroeconomic practice:\noverlay or directly compute PiT term structure with\n• Not using data for an entire business cycle (eight\nmacroeconomic overlay basis remaining lifetime of\nto ten years) or for at least five years, even when\nthe facility.\nsuch data is available\nECL guidelines are generally principal based and\n• Poor data quality with issues such as missing\nprovide leeway to FIs in selecting the methodology it\nvalues, outliers, and incorrect data are noted\nwants to adopt for computation purposes.

Recoveries can be in the form of cash (unsecured recovery) or by possession\nor sale of collateral (secured recoveries). FIs can use different method to compute LGD. Some of the methods\nthat can be used are:\nWorkout LGD Market LGD Asset pricing/implied LGD\nwhere FI’s internal data and where market price of where LGD is derived basis\nrecovery is used for LGD defaulted instruments is used credit spreads on the non-\ncomputation to estimate LGD defaulted risky bonds or credit\nderivatives such as CDS\nQuantitative models Regulatory LGD\nwhere LGD is derived basis where regulatory prescribed\nmethods such as linear unsecured LGD and collateral\nregressions, fractional logistic, haircuts are used to compute\nJacob Frye, and decision tree secured LGD.\nmodels\nAs mentioned earlier from PD perspective, even for 4.

As per current market practice, single unsecured discount rate to compute LGD.\nLGD is computed which is applied for all facilities\nirrespective of stage, or residual life of the\nfacility. As generally been noted, LGD should\nincrease basis credit risk i.e., LGD for accounts in\nstage three should be higher than for accounts in\nstage two. Similarly, for stage three accounts\nalso, recovery drops as time elapses and thus\naccounts with higher vintage in default should\nhave higher LGD. For this, FIs can try to compute\nprogressive LGD or LGD term structure so that\nappropriate LGD is used for ECL computation\n2. FIs can conduct vintage analysis to determine\ntime period in which maximum recovery will\noccur and accordingly use data for that time\nperiod for LGD estimate. FIs can use methods\nlike chain ladder to forecast LGD for recent\ndefault cases where recovery has not been\ncompleted\n3. FIs can also compute cure rate basis accounts\nwhich went in default but have paid all arrears\nand became standard within short period of time\nsuch as within three to six months\n10 | Expected Credit Loss (ECL)\n3.6 Exposure At Default (EAD)\nAs per Global Public Policy Committee (GPPC) paper, ECL which will impact P&L statements. By\nas published in June 2016, “EAD is an estimate of incorporating prepayments in EAD, FIs can factor in\nthe exposure at a future default date, taking into principal repayment that borrower is expected to\naccount expected changes in the exposure after the make over and above the contractual amount and\nreporting date, including repayments of principal and thus reduce ECL charge for stage two accounts with\ninterest, and expected drawdowns on committed long residual lifetime.

For the same, FIs can use different\nmethods to model CCF basis data availability:\n1. Basis internal historical data using methods such\nas cohort approach or fixed horizon method\n2. Regression based model basis relevant factors\n3. Monte-Carlo simulation-based models\n4. Machine learning based model such as K-Nearest\nNeighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine\n(SVM)\n5. Regulatory prescribed factors.\nAmortisation- Basis the capability of the ECL system\nimplemented, FIs can use amortisation schedule as\nper contractual cash flows i.e., monthly, quarterly, or\nsemi-annually or annually as per terms. As of now,\nwe have seen FIs either do not use amortisation in\nEAD computation or assume annual amortisation.\nECL computed under either of the approaches will be\nconservative depending upon the stage and residual\nmaturity of the contract. But FIs will need strategic\nsystem or models on platforms such as\nR/SAS/Python which can handle large data set that is\nrequired to use actual cash flow or cash flow\ngenerated basis models.\nPrepayment – Incorporation of prepayment in ECL\ncomputation will help FIs rationalise EAD and in turn\n3. \"The implementation of IFRS 9 impairment requirements by banks” issued by the Global Public Policy Committee of representatives of the six\nlargest accounting networks in June 2016\nExpected Credit Loss (ECL) | 11\n3.7 Effective Interest Rate (EIR)\nEffective interest rate is the rate that exactly should compute CEIR and for other assets, it should\ndiscounts estimated future cash payments or compute EIR.

Additionally, the framework requires FIs to compute ECL under different\nmacroeconomic forecast and compute weighted ECL basis different macroeconomic conditions. Some of the\npoints that FIs should note in selection and modelling for weighted ECL are listed below:\n01 02\nFIs can either forecast MEV basis internal Relevant macroeconomic models for\nmodels or use external forecast published different segments/pools should be selected\nby reputable agencies basis quantitative and qualitative analysis\n03 04\nFIs should select same variables as far as MEV forecast for the variables should be used\npossible for ECL computation and other risk consistently in different risk purposes such as\nmanagement and stress testing purposes ALM and stress testing\n05 06 Rationale for weights used for different\nAssumptions and limitations in selection\nmacroeconomic scenarios should be\nand computation of forward looking ECL\ndocumented and validated as part of model\nshould be identified and validated\nvalidation.\nIn our view, not incorporating forecasted MEV in ECL computation will not comply with the regulations. FIs\nshould select relevant MEV and incorporate these while modelling ECL.\n3.9 Post Model Adjustment (PMAs)\nand Overlays\nPost model adjustments and overlays are used\nwhere the risks and uncertainties cannot be correctly\npredicted or quantified basis model. Overlays are the\nadjustments made to the existing models’ output,\nand these adjustments can be subjective or\njudgmental or at times both. These risks are not\ncaptured by the models because they are not\ndesigned to address uncertainties, such as those\nseen during the global financial crisis of 2007-08,\nCOVID-19 pandemic or recent interest rate hikes. The\nkey considerations for computation of PMA and\noverlays are:\n• The approach for applying PMAs should be\nappropriate and clearly understandable, ensuring\nthat these adjustments effectively address the\nlimitations of the model\n• The methodology for computing and applying\nPMAs must be thoroughly documented\n• There should be defined governance structure to\nincorporate such PMAs\n• FIs should conduct back testing to validate for\nrelevance and adequacy of PMAs.\nExpected Credit Loss (ECL) | 13\n4. Validation of the models\nAs per RBI guidelines, FIs should have independent first line (model developer) and second line (model\nthree lines of defence to manage model risk and as validator) have performed due diligence and\nper that, all ECL models should be independently complied with all applicable internal policies and\nvalidated4 before deployment as well as periodically procedures as well as regulatory guidelines.\nmonitored and validated as per MRM policy of the\nModel validator to conduct comprehensive check on\nFI.5 Additionally, entire process of model\nentire model development process and challenge\ndevelopment and validation has to be reviewed by\nmodel developer.

Key challenges\nBelow are the key challenges, grouped into different categories, that we have noticed while assisting\ndifferent FIs globally in their journey of IFRS9/IndAS109/ASC 326 implementation and subsequent validation:\nData\nBasis our experience, data is biggest challenge for ECL computation. Some of the data challenges\nwe noticed are in terms of historical data availability, data quality, data integration across various\nsystems, data volume, and lack of availability of critical data in digital format in the system. Due\nto such issues, many FIs go for regulatory backstop for different components which might result\nin conservative ECL estimation\nMethodology\nMany FIs do not select model methodology basis availability of volume and quality of data, or\nconsidering process, IT, and people capability. In our view, using appropriate methodology is\ncritical in having robust ECL framework and thus it is selected after due considerations on various\naspects. Also, to avoid undue volatility in provisions, model methodology selected should be\nrobust and should not require frequent changes\nProcess\nECL computation requires coordination among different departments and thus having robust\nprocess for entire ECL computations i.e., data extractions, model running, computation and\nreporting is critical. Additionally, as the numbers are reported in financial statements, any delay\nor break in the process might result in inaccurate or delay in statements which might impact\nreputation of the FI. Implementing Target Operating Model (TOM) and Business as Usual (BAU)\nprocess requires a lot of deliberation among different stakeholders\nPeople\nHaving adequate resources in different departments with relevant knowledge and experience is\ncritical both during development of framework and as part of BAU. Many a times we find that FIs\nhave key man risk in critical departments. FIs can take help of consultants as and when required\nfor this purpose\nIT System\nMany FIs still rely on spreadsheets for ECL computation which might not be optimum given the\nvolume of data that needs to be processed for both - computation of different components and\nfinal ECL estimates at each reporting date. In our view, FIs should invest in either strategic or\ntactical system depending on volume of data that is expected to be handled\nExpected Credit Loss (ECL) | 15\nGovernance and controls\nDefining appropriate governance with clear roles and responsibilities for all the stakeholders is\ncritical and requires deliberations with different teams. Also, appropriate Turnaround Time (TAT)\nand escalation matrix should also be defined so that there is no delay in financial reporting.\nAdditionally, as the numbers are reported in the financial statements, designing, and\nimplementing effective controls for the entire ECL framework process became paramount\nMIS\nThere is no MIS report/dashboard so that senior management have adequate oversight on\nmovement of ECL provisions and can intervene in timely manner before provisions breach risk\nthresholds.\nIn our view, FIs should assess all such areas to\nensure they have robust ECL framework which\ncan work efficiently as part of BAU process.\nAdditionally, there should be clear plan on how\nany gaps and challenges will be addressed within\nstipulated timelines. To emphasise again, as ECL\nprovisions need to be reported in the financial\nstatements along with change in provision at\neach reporting date, FIs should strive to have\nrobust ECL framework so that volatility in\nprovisions is reduced which will give confidence\nto regulators, shareholders, potential investors,\nand other stakeholders.\n16 | Expected Credit Loss (ECL)\n6. Key impacted areas\nIn our experience, ECL implementation will not only any major failure might have adverse\nimpact complete credit lifecycle but also other reputational impact.

It mandates that Regulated\nentities (REs) regularly conduct an Internal risk assessment (IRA) to identify, assess, and mitigate risks.\nThe focus on the risk based approach (RBA) is crucial as it provides flexibility for REs to tailor their\ncontrols.

Identification and assessment of ML/TF risk factors: The guidance note gives an indicative list of inherent\nand control risk factors that the REs need to consider while identifying and assessing the ML/TF risks they are\nexposed to. Following are a few of them enlisted in the note:\nInherent risk factors Control risk factors\nNature, scale, diversity and complexity Ability or lack thereof, to obtain necessary\nof their business diam no information in case of wire transfers\nThe jurisdictions the REs are exposed to,\nCustomer profile and type of especially jurisdictions with relatively\nproducts/services offered to them higher level of corruption, and/or\ndeficient AML/CFT controls\nThe volume and size of their Distribution channels such as ATMs,\ntransactions business correspondents, mobile\napplications etc.\nType of customers-individual/legal Dependance on third parties or\nentity/legal arrangement including trusts. unregulated intermediaries\nType of on-boarding- face-to-face or Internal audit and regulatory\nnon-face-to-face observations\nThis granular assessment of risk factors help REs to determine the level of CDD that is to be applied in specific\nsituations, and to particular types of customers, products, services, and delivery channels.\n3\n5.

Based on that\nassessment, countries should apply a risk-based approach (RBA) to ensure that measures to prevent or\nmitigate money laundering and terrorist financing are commensurate with the risks identified.\nBasel committee on banking supervision guidelines\nBanks must implement robust policies and processes, including strict customer due diligence (CDD) rules,\nto uphold high ethical standards and prevent misuse for criminal activities. Sound risk management\ninvolves identifying and analysing ML/FT risks within the bank and designing appropriate policies and\nprocedures. Banks should conduct comprehensive risk assessments considering factors at the country,\nsectoral, bank, and business relationship levels to determine their risk profile and necessary mitigation\nmeasures.\n3. a.

The Wolfsberg Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on Risk Assessments for Money Laundering, Sanctions and Bribery & Corruption, 2015\n6\nFATF- TF risk assessment guidance-July 2019\nA comprehensive assessment of terrorist financing (TF) risks requires the involvement of various key\nauthorities, including intelligence and security agencies, law enforcement, financial intelligence units,\ncustoms, and regulatory bodies. The methodology for assessing TF risks should be flexible and tailored to\nthe specific characteristics of each jurisdiction. It involves collecting a wide range of quantitative and\nqualitative information on the criminal environment, TF threats, vulnerabilities of specific sectors, and the\njurisdiction’s counter-terrorism financing (CFT) capacity.\nFinancing risk assessment and mitigation-June 2021\nA PF risk assessment aims to identify, analyse, and mitigate PF risks through a systematic process\ninvolving both government and private sector stakeholders. This assessment should be comprehensive\nenough to inform national counter-proliferation strategies and ensure effective implementation of TFS. It\ninvolves compiling data on known threats, key sectors, and activities of designated individuals or entities.\nFor private firms, relevant data includes customer due diligence information, transaction records, and threat\nanalysis reports.\nEuropean banking authority guidelines\nTo comply with directive (EU) 2015/849, firms must assess the money laundering (ML) and terrorist\nfinancing (TF) risks they face due to their business’s nature and complexity (business-wide risk\nassessment) and from individual business relationships or transactions (individual risk assessments). They\nshould evaluate both inherent risks and the effectiveness of their controls and mitigation measures. The\nbusiness-wide risk assessment should be tailored to the firm’s specific profile, considering all relevant\nfactors and risks, whether conducted internally or by an external party. When identifying ML/TF risks in\nbusiness relationships or transactions, firms should consider customer profiles, geographical areas,\nproducts, services, transactions, and delivery channels.\nWolfsberg FAQs on risk assessments for money laundering, sanctions and bribery & corruption\nThe primary goal of a money laundering risk assessment is to enhance financial crime risk management by\nidentifying the specific and general money laundering risks faced by a financial institution (FI), evaluating\nhow these risks are mitigated by the institution’s anti-money laundering (AML) controls, and determining the\nresidual risk. The outcomes of such an assessment can be used to identify gaps in AML policies, make\ninformed decisions about risk appetite and resource allocation, align AML compliance programs with risk\nprofiles, develop risk mitigation strategies, inform senior management and regulators about key risks and\ncontrol gaps, and ensure that resources and priorities are appropriately aligned with the institution’s risks.\nConclusion\nThe guidance note is a welcome move from the RBI as\nit makes AML/TF risk assessment process more\nstreamlined. It equips the financial institutions to\nmanage not just today’s risks, but also anticipate and\nmitigate future challenges in the ever-evolving\nlandscape of financial crimes. Moreover, the adoption\nof a risk-based approach, detailed methodology for\nrisk identification, and the inclusion of proliferation\nfinancing risks align Indian financial institutions with\ninternational standards.\n7\nKPMG in India contacts:\nE: atuteja@kpmg.com\nAccess our latest insights\non KPMG Insights Edge\nThe information contained herein is of a general nature and is not intended to address the circumstances of any particular individual or entity.

However, the sector faces several challenges, including workforce and technology skills shortages, data privacy and security concerns, and keeping up with the relentless pace of technological change. With technology, a key sectoral transformation pillar, it can be helpful for leaders in the sector to have insights on how other healthcare technology leaders are targeting their investments and deriving value. The KPMG global tech report: Healthcare insights examines the views of senior-level healthcare technology function leaders from around the world that include chief digital officers, CIOs, CTOs, CISOs, chief AI officers and others.

The sector may also be\nmissing a valuable way to grow their data maturity here, because data management and integration have been the top advantages gained from XaaS technologies over the past 12 months, averaged across all sectors. But, in a\nsector where data security and data privacy are so pressing, this elevated level of caution and lack of proactivity in relation to XaaS and Cloud solutions are understandable.

Exploring trends, innovations, and opportunities in senior living to create inclusive, future-ready communities for the evolving silver generation Share The global senior living market, valued at approximately USD 190 Bn in 2020, is poised to double to USD 375 Bn by 2030, driven by shifting demographics and rising life expectancy. The silver economy comprising older adults as active economic participants has emerged as a powerful force for economic and social transformation. No longer merely recipients of care, older adults are increasingly contributing to economic growth. By fostering innovation, inclusive policies, and sustainable infrastructure, the silver economy presents a unique opportunity to reshape societies for a more resilient and adaptive future. India is poised to play a crucial role in this evolving landscape. By 2050, India is projected to account for 16 per cent of the global population aged 60 and older approximately 346 Mn seniors out of an estimated 2.1 Bn worldwide. While this percentage is lower than some countries, India’s sheer population size makes this shift economically and socially significant. This demographic wave will profoundly impact healthcare, social services, and economic policies, making senior living a critical sector for national development. India’s senior living sector is at a nascent stage but holds immense promise. Cities such as Pune (1.2 Mn seniors) and Bengaluru (1.03 Mn seniors) are witnessing robust growth in senior demographics, while Chennai, Kolkata, Coimbatore, and Hyderabad have shown steady increases. However, large untapped markets in northern and central regions remain underdeveloped due to cultural preferences for family caregiving and limited supply of senior living facilities. Bridging this gap will require tailored solutions that align with the diverse needs and aspirations of Indian seniors. Adopting global best practices will be key to unlocking India’s senior living potential. This includes, centralised and localised policy frameworks, innovative rental and ownership models, flexible financing options and incentives, seamless integration with healthcare providers. The senior living sector offers diverse operating models, each with unique benefits and challenge The most preferred option, providing tangible ownership and long-term capital appreciation Gaining gradual acceptance, this model offers steady income for developers and greater flexibility for seniors Popular in countries like Australia and the UK, this model involves paying a lower upfront entry fee for accommodation, with a portion of the fee retained by the operator as a management fee, typically deducted when the resident vacates the unit or upon resale. This helps balance affordability with stability Currently, 84 per cent of India’s senior living supply caters to independent living designed for active seniors, while 16 per cent serves assisted living needs. However, skilled nursing facilities for seniors requiring continuous medical support are limited in scale. This is because the demand is relatively low and depends on individual cases, typically arising only in chronic conditions requiring constant support. Realising India’s senior living potential requires a collaborative effort among policymakers, developers, investors, and operators. Government support through tax incentives, subsidised land, and regulatory frameworks will be critical in attracting private investment and making senior housing more accessible and affordable. To truly make an impact, India’s regulatory framework must address, diverse medical needs and care requirements also ensuring quality in the same time, affordability across income groups, inclusive community building models. By blending global best practices with India-specific solutions, the senior living sector can create a sustainable, equitable, and future-ready ecosystem empowering older adults to lead healthier, more fulfilling lives while driving economic growth. The time to act is now. With the right vision, partnerships, and policies, India can unlock the immense potential of its aging population and position itself at the forefront of the global silver economy revolution.

It further covers potential tax benefits of the GIFT IFSC related to direct tax, indirect tax and other incentives. With the government's focus on holistic and balanced growth across India, the country is expected to achieve a CAGR of 7-9 per cent in air passenger traffic over the next two decades, indicating a promising future. This trend is mirrored by Indian carriers such as IndiGo and Air India, which are placing record orders to meet passenger demand. Consequently, the aircraft fleet is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.0-6.3 per cent, primarily driven by wide-body aircraft Given the substantial investment required for aircraft, the industry is increasingly shifting towards leasing rather than owning aircraft. This approach offers benefits such as maintaining asset-light financials, flexibility in adjusting capacity based on demand, and reduced operational costs. Establishing leasing infrastructure in India will not only bolster the aviation industry but also contribute to the country's economic growth The IFSC at GIFT City is a strategic initiative by the government to support the leasing industry in India. The IFSC provides access to global financial markets and currencies, enabling airlines and aviation-related businesses to raise capital from international investors. Additionally, the IFSC offers a robust regulatory framework and tax incentives for aircraft leasing and financing, allowing airlines to procure aircraft at competitive rates and reducing their financial burden While the IFSC at GIFT City is a commendable initiative by the government to attract lessors to India and considerable grounds have been covered in last few years, there are aspects that need to be addressed to position India as a competitive player in the industry. GIFT City must continue to evolve its regulatory framework, tax incentives, address financing challenges, and facilitate ease of doing business to develop the aircraft leasing and financing ecosystem in GIFT IFSC In addition to providing a robust regulatory framework for the smooth functioning of the aircraft leasing industry at the IFSC, it also offers numerous tax benefits to incentivize participation. These incentives include, but are not limited to, deductions and exemptions on income, capital gains, and dividend payable. Furthermore, the introduction of the Protection of Interests in Aircraft Objects Bill aims to enhance legal protection for lessors by addressing concerns about aircraft repossession during airline insolvencies. The bill establishes a legal framework that ensures lessors can promptly reclaim their aircraft if an airline defaults on lease payments or goes bankrupt. By offering these protections, the bill aims to make GIFT City an attractive hub for international lessors, thereby supporting the growth of the aircraft leasing industry in India Partner and Head, Aviation Sector KPMG in India",

Share Food security has been a critical aspect of India's public policy since Independence. While the country ranks among the top global food producers and exporters, millions still struggle with access to adequate and nutritious food. According to the 2024 Global Hunger Index (GHI), India ranks 105th out of 127 countries, highlighting the persistent challenges of hunger and malnutrition. Additionally, the UN’s State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI) report states that over 19.46 crore people—approximately 13.4% of India’s population—are chronically undernourished. Strengthening India’s public food distribution system (PDS) One of the key strategies to achieve zero hunger is strengthening India’s public food distribution system (PDS). The Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) has been instrumental in providing subsidized food grains to millions. However, challenges such as inefficiencies in supply chain management, leakages, and exclusion errors must be addressed through digital reforms, Aadhaar-linked beneficiary tracking, and improved last-mile delivery mechanisms. Sustainable Agriculture Sustainable agriculture is another crucial pillar in ensuring long-term food security. Promoting climate-resilient farming practices, enhancing irrigation efficiency, and encouraging crop diversification can help improve productivity while preserving natural resources. Additionally, supporting smallholder farmers through direct income support, improved market linkages, and access to quality seeds and fertilizers will contribute to a more robust food supply system. Balanced Nutrition Another major aspect of food security is ensuring balanced nutrition, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. Government programs like the Mid-Day Meal Scheme (MDMS) and the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) play a vital role in addressing malnutrition. Expanding these programs with fortified foods, nutrition education, and community participation can further enhance their impact. Technology and Innovation Technology and innovation can also drive improvements in food security. The use of artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and remote sensing can help monitor food supply chains, reduce wastage, and optimize distribution. Digital platforms connecting farmers directly to consumers can eliminate middlemen, ensuring better prices for farmers and lower costs for consumers. Additionally, achieving food security and zero hunger requires collaboration across various stakeholders, including government bodies, private sector players, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and international agencies. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) can help scale up successful models of food production, distribution, and nutritional interventions. Global best practices, such as Brazil’s Zero Hunger Program, can offer valuable insights for policy refinement in India. Lastly, raising awareness about sustainable consumption and reducing food waste are essential. Strengthening food banks, promoting community kitchens, and encouraging responsible consumer behavior can significantly impact food security at the grassroots level. India has made progress in improving food availability, but significant challenges remain in accessibility and affordability. A multi-pronged approach integrating efficient distribution, sustainable agriculture, nutritional programs, technology-driven solutions, and strong policy frameworks is essential to achieve zero hunger and food security for all. With concerted efforts, India can move closer to eradicating hunger and malnutrition, ensuring a healthier and more prosperous future for its citizens. The report outlines solutions for achieving zero hunger and ensuring food and nutritional security through a multi-stakeholder approach, addressing gaps in access, distribution, and agricultural sustainability Partner and Lead – Food, Agri & Allied Services, Government & Public Services KPMG in India",

    "content": "Transformation Artificial Intelligence How we work Your search term was too short. Search terms must include 3 or more characters. Share The report, \"Enabling Infrastructure Changes through Policies for Growth of EVs,\" underscores the critical role of infrastructure in accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in India. It highlights the need for comprehensive policy support across four key areas: physical infrastructure, power infrastructure, economic infrastructure, and social infrastructure. Physical infrastructure focuses on developing a robust and distributed charging ecosystem and establishing battery recycling facilities. The report stresses the importance of standardizing charger connectors, selecting optimal locations for new charging stations, and reducing the upfront costs for Charge Point Operators (CPOs). It also advocates for the integration of renewable energy sources to support EV charging and the augmentation of distribution assets to manage the increasing power demand. Power infrastructure involves managing the growing electricity demand and improving the quality of power supply. The report suggests promoting on-grid solar charging stations and adopting the Green Energy Open Access Rules, 2022, to facilitate the use of renewable energy among industrial and commercial consumers. Economic infrastructure aims to ensure access to low-cost capital for EV buyers and create an efficient taxation structure across the EV value chain. The report recommends achieving parity in the GST structure for EV components and vehicles, adding EVs to the priority sector lending list for banks, and supporting innovative vehicle ownership models such as battery-as-a-service and battery leasing. Social infrastructure focuses on educating and enhancing the capabilities of various stakeholders, including fleet drivers, traditional mechanics, and manufacturing workers. The report highlights the need for targeted training and skill development programs, incorporating EV-specific courses in Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), and incentivizing companies offering internships in related areas. It also emphasizes the importance of raising public awareness about the benefits of EVs through marketing campaigns and supporting incentives like free parking and toll tax exemptions. The report concludes that right policy support and faster decision-making can foster collaborations across stakeholders in the EV ecosystem, including government bodies, private enterprises, and international partners. This collaborative approach is essential for driving innovation and investment, which are crucial for developing infrastructure that keeps pace with the growing demand for EVs. By addressing these infrastructure needs, India can significantly advance its EV adoption, reduce its oil import bill, and lower CO2 emissions, contributing to a more sustainable future. In summary, this report provides a comprehensive roadmap for enhancing India's EV infrastructure through strategic policy changes. It emphasizes collaboration among various stakeholders to create a supportive ecosystem that promotes sustainable urban transportation while fostering economic growth.
