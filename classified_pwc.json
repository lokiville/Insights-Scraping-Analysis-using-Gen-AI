growing concern only 15 of plastic waste gets collected for recycling at a global scale and nearly half of it still ends up being discarded irresponsibly 1 this indicates that only 9 of waste actually gets recycled 2 over the last two decades the world has doubled its production of plastic with most of it ending up in landfills or being incinerated a recent organisation for economic co operation and development oecd report reveals that a staggering 91 of waste is not recycled 3 another report by the united nations environment programme unep indicates that in 2016 an estimated 11 million metric tonnes of plastic trash found its way into the ocean 4 india plays a significant role in the plastic waste crisis the country is one of the twelve countries which are accountable for 60 of the worlds mismanaged plastic 5 with a population exceeding 1 4 billion people india produces 26 000 tonnes of plastic waste daily which is equivalent to about 26 000 small cars 6 in a bid to combat this on 5 june 2018 the prime minister announced that india would phase out single use plastics by 2022 following this on 12 august 2021 the ministry of environment forest and climate change moefcc enforced a ban on certain single use plastic items from 1 july 2022 since 2016 the plastic waste management rules have made it mandatory for users of plastics to collect and recycle their waste these extended producer responsibility epr rules initially voluntary are now enforced through an online epr trading platform 7 8 the retail and consumer goods industry is facing growing pressure to adopt sustainable practices driven by regulations investors and consumers the twenty first century s consumers focus on human rights tackling climate change and supporting businesses which embrace circular economy practices in india a majority of consumers are now willing to invest more in products with sustainable and minimal packaging for their purchases in recent times there have been major changes in india s regulatory landscape to improve plastic waste management and effectively implement epr the central pollution control board cpcb the ministry of environment forest and climate change moefcc and the food safety and standards authority of india fssai have come up with new laws and policy regulations which indicate a promising movement towards tackling the country s waste management

packaging in the fmcg and retail sector 5 april 2025 02 sustainable packaging and esg integration most packaging strategies tend to focus on actions that are largely based on market trends and internal systems practised by established organisations a structured esg governance framework is crucial for executing a sustainable packaging strategy in a company brand perception of sustainability is shaped by both external communication and internal performance aligning green marketing outreach with sustainability reporting standards is crucial for companies to have effective outbound communication mechanisms let us explore these elements in detail figure 2 a holistic approach to sustainable packaging practices source pwc analysis pwc sustainable packaging in the fmcg and retail sector 6 april 2025 03 to boost profitability and meet both mandatory and voluntary targets companies must optimise packaging and make it more economical and sustainable this involves focusing on four key action fields rethink reduce reuse and recycle rethink this action requires a fundamental rethinking of product and portfolio design and business processes to reduce the use of plastic across its products and logistics companies might also need to venture into other segments of the value chain such as the recycling market and determine outsourcing options to secure long term material access reduce reducing resource consumption is a strategic lever for companies which are aiming to save costs while meeting their sustainability goals the primary focus is on reducing packaging material itself as seen through lightweighting or designing with less material reducing energy requirements transportation needs and packaging related waste are key focus areas for reducing plastic waste reuse packaging designed for multiple uses such as refillable containers or returnable crates can significantly cut down the use of single use waste reuse strategies also pave the way for closed loop systems that can strengthen consumer relationships recycle though recycling is important finding the right method of recycling is essential to yield the best results one of the ways in which recycling can be effectively implemented is by using materials which are easily recyclable and support the existing recycling infrastructure figure 3 holistic and sustainable packaging optimisation action

retail sector 9 april 2025 implementing any sustainability initiative requires a robust governance framework to ensure effective decision making accountability and continuous improvement this framework ensures that decisions are made effectively responsibilities are clear and progress is consistently monitored a comprehensive esg governance model seamlessly integrates sustainability into the business operations while fostering innovation adherence to regulations and operational excellence it is important to verify if the current organisational structure adequately supports the packaging strategy to guarantee its successful implementation across all levels of the organisation figure 5 depicts how sustainable packaging practices can be structured within an organisation the figure showcases how business operations sustainability management functions and board level oversight work together harmoniously business operations handle the aspects of sustainable packaging such as planning execution and monitoring to ensure that the daily activities align with sustainability objectives sustainability management functions focus on evaluation validation of practices and managing risks associated with sustainability efforts the board sets directions and policies that guide sustainability initiatives across the organisation communication and feedback mechanisms among these entities facilitate ongoing assessment and enhancement of sustainability measures figure 5 an illustrative governance framework for sustainable packaging practices esg governance in packaging 05 source pwc analysis pwc sustainable packaging in the fmcg and retail sector 10 april 2025 06 centralising packaging data for effective esg reporting once the metrics and kpis are identified regular monitoring and evaluation of organisational control over this information becomes indispensable becoming an esg ready organisation depends on centralising data collection the quality and granularity of data is important as it helps derive meaningful insights which can help the leadership in making informed decisions managing diverse metrics such as type and quantity of materials used recycled content in materials energy consumption recyclability rate and other metrics collected from multiple data owners often requires a streamlined data collection methodology across the organisation the most effective approach involves taking a detailed journey through each metric s lifecycle from its source data establishing crucial rules for information governance involves implementing an impactful tiered approach and categorising data based on relevance and impact organisational clarity is ensured by clearly defining these categories and aligning them with specific requirements this streamlines the incorporation of existing metrics and the integration of new metrics into the esg reporting framework as well as ensuring continuous improvement of the overall esg performance and reporting processes figure 6 an illustrative packaging related data collection and monitoring dashboard source pwc analysis pwc sustainable packaging in the fmcg and retail sector 11 april 2025 07 collaborative partnerships for a circular packaging value chain it is important to form partnerships at every level of the value chain to collectively close the circular loop of raw materials and packaging waste by collaborating with suppliers to ensure that they provide details on the recyclability and recycled materials in the packaging they supply building partnerships with raw material manufacturers to develop innovative solutions working together with the state governments waste collectors sorters and processors to collaboratively establish an end of life system that promotes recyclability achieving circular packaging necessitates collaboration across the value chain once a product reaches the end of its lifecycle and becomes waste various recycling methods such as waste sorting mechanical recycling and chemical recycling can be implemented to ensure its recyclability thereby preventing the waste from reaching landfills or being incinerated numerous stakeholders such as municipalities waste management firms physical and chemical recyclers and intermediaries play a crucial role in this value chain and by partnering with recyclers and waste management entities organisations can create an infrastructure that supports complete recyclability of these waste materials figure 7 illustrates the plastic value chain highlighting the key stakeholders stages of production and recycling processes figure 7 an overview of key stakeholders and processes in the plastic value chain source pwc analysis pwc sustainable packaging in the fmcg and retail sector 12 april 2025 08 linking sustainability efforts with brand perception an organisation s sustainability initiatives and branding activities are closely intertwined as many consumers assess the company on the basis of their internal esg performance how a brand s sustainability efforts are perceived is shaped by how it communicates its presence through media and its sustainability initiatives conveying the brand s voice and message along with eco labelling the products plays an important role in shaping the consumers views about the brand however perception alone is not enough the internal operations of a company drive the authenticity and impact of its sustainability efforts this includes practices like sourcing eco friendly materials using energy efficient packaging methods and designing packaging that reduces material usage and waste production training the employees is also important to ensure that sustainable practices become a part of the company s culture figure 8 the role of sustainability in shaping brand perception and shaping consumer trust source pwc analysis pwc sustainable packaging in the fmcg and retail sector 13 april 2025 09 communicating sustainability initiatives communication plays an important role in convincing various stakeholders about the sincerity of a company s sustainability endeavours while some standards such as the global reporting initiative gri integrated reporting ir framework sustainability accounting standards board sasb task force on climate related financial disclosures tcfd united nations sustainable development goals un sdgs among others are non mandatory and non binding other standards and frameworks such as the business responsibility and sustainability reporting brsr european sustainability reporting standards esrs corporate sustainability reporting directive csrd and the climate related disclosures by securities and exchange commission sec are mandatory in certain cases internationally accepted reporting frameworks such as gri sasb tcfd integrated reporting are referred to by regulatory authorities for cross referencing though these frameworks and standards share some similarities there are instances where they don t align which can pose practical challenges for companies which are aiming to create unified and consistent reports that meets the expectations of both investors and jurisdictional compliance and regulations ensuring alignment of standards and frameworks is crucial for developing a comprehensive reporting procedure figure 9 an illustrative framework for effective packaging impact reporting the disclosure of positive impacts from sustainable packaging initiatives involves three key steps evaluate conclude report coupled with six fundamental questions these steps and questions provide a straightforward lucid and practical approach to enhance the confidence in externally reported packaging endeavours the questions cover why sustainability packaging information is reported and for whom setting the stage for subsequent decisions on where to report what to report how to report and how much to report addressing questions 1 and 2 guides companies in determining the purpose and audience for packaging efforts this foundation in turn informs decisionmakers and helps them decide where and what to report how to prepare and present the information and how much information to disclose while questions 1 and 2 precede the others the dynamic nature of the process acknowledges the interplay between questions and steps emphasising their interconnectedness when making judgments about information disclosure the strength of an organisation s initiatives lies in their relevance and transparency reinforcing their commitment to authentic and impactful sustainability practices source pwc analysis pwc sustainable packaging in the fmcg and retail sector 14 april 2025 10 conclusion driving sustainable packaging initiatives requires supervision by an internal stakeholder along with a comprehensive governance of the process and essential core capabilities that companies often lack though the sustainability team is often the first point of contact for this process procurement sourcing and innovation departments can also become the drivers for packaging optimisation companies need to address the following aspects to effectively tackle the problem of sustainable packaging collaboration between various departments integration of cost and sustainability packaging kpis analysing the portfolio engaging in value chain and ecosystem collaboration capacity building for teams committing to packaging targets set for the organisation strengthening communication with suppliers conducting lifecycle assessments of packaging materials adopting eco friendly packaging messaging and branding fostering cross industry partnerships for joint sustainability initiatives in order to achieve impactful results in driving sustainable packaging

a strategic blueprint to harness india s demographic dividend 4 foreword as the world deliberates upon how cross border mobility can address workforce shortages global policy dialogues and collaborative efforts have become more crucial india standing at the cusp of a pivotal economic and demographic shift is well positioned to cater to the global demand for talent the report making the case for global workforce migration a strategic blueprint to harness india s demographic dividend aims to contribute to the dialogue and highlight india s role in shaping the future of work and labour force mobility it outlines important policy recommendations to address the key barriers in labour migration pathways and enhance international dialogue and cooperation to maximise the economic benefits of labour mobility thereby help nurture prosperity for the global economy while the idea of promoting fair labour migration and mobility is not new its criticality has gained prominence as the world stands at the crossroads of massive economic geopolitical and technological transformations this report aims to serve the role of a strategic reference for policymakers industry leaders the

orfonline org sanjeev krishan chairperson pwc india sanjeev krishan pwc com pwc making the case for global workforce migration a strategic blueprint to harness india s demographic dividend 5 global labour migration has been instrumental in shaping how societies are formed and how economies function since the establishment of ancient trade routes to present day labour migration has been an important factor in defining global geopolitical dynamics and shaping the socioeconomic fabric though labour migration is typically influenced by employment opportunities and earning potential factors such as economic stability geopolitical dynamics national security concerns and the pursuit of higher living standards are also gaining prominence in influencing the workforce s decision global workforce therefore stands at a crossroad where global labour migration landscape is dotted with multiple challenges and requires a unified policy framework coordinated international support and efforts for aiding labour migration flow across the world and to leverage human capital for global growth and prosperity the key challenges that the world is witnessing today in the context of labour migration are multidimensional spanning across policy and regulatory hurdles including lack of adequate social security mechanisms inadequate skill recognition and skill mismatch short term employment contracts and low social cultural and political receptiveness against this backdrop this paper attempts to provide a comprehensive understanding of the global labour migration landscape with a focus on the underlying economic frameworks and cross country evidence of evolving labour migration patterns its socio economic implications and how india s demographic dividend can be leveraged in this context the first chapter looks at the dual role of labour a crucial production factor and a demand driver and its complementary relationship with technology in augmenting economic output and sustainable growth the chapter enumerates the evolution of global labour migration patterns shaped by social economic political and technological factors as well as the structural shifts in labour migration patterns in the recent decade driven by technological advancements it also examines the challenges and opportunities related to global labour migration setting the context for a detailed discussion in the later chapters the second chapter looks at the evolution of labour migration theories driven by factors like population changes differential wages and technological changes it explains the tenets of a fundamental model of global labour migration and talks about both the economic and social benefits of global labour migration including skills transfer entrepreneurship innovation remittances and higher gross domestic product gdp growth the third chapter highlights the evolving labour migration trends with an analysis of immigration policies in key destination countries like the united arab emirates uae and the united states us it also looks at frameworks like asean qualifications reference framework aqrf and european initiatives like the europass which aids labour migration across the world the fourth chapter discusses the key challenges to labour migration ranging from cultural and social barriers to institutional impediments like the absence of bilateral and multilateral diplomatic agreements the chapter also highlights concepts like the lottery of birth 1 encapsulating the inherent advantages or disadvantages migrants face due to their birthplace the fifth chapter focusses on india underpinning its crucial position in the global labour migration landscape and identifying trends in indian labour migration while also detailing the country s public and private sector initiatives aimed at facilitating international labour mobility the sixth chapter looks at the convergence of labour economics and international relations highlighting the need for institutional arrangements to attain an equilibrium in global labour supply and demand furthermore it enumerates how indian labour markets can assume an important role in the global workforce landscape by aligning with global policies and institutional frameworks to fully leverage the economic potential of labour migration for both the domestic and global economy the seventh chapter maps global labour opportunities emphasising india s role in addressing workforce shortages in mature economies like germany japan and canada the section highlights how barriers such as skill mismatches regulatory complexities and qualification recognition persist and can be mitigated by strengthening skilling initiatives aligning certifications with global standards and leveraging ai driven training platforms lastly the concluding chapter on policy recommendations highlights how a sustainable workforce mobility framework necessitates robust alignment between domestic skill development initiatives and evolving international labour demands a dynamic future ready labour mobility strategy can position india as a leading global talent supplier while maximising reciprocal economic benefits 1 note lottery of birth refers to the concept that the circumstances into which a person is born such as location time family and societal context are matters of chance

1 1 labour as a critical input labour has been a crucial and indispensable force throughout every phase of economic evolution acting as the backbone of production growth and economic development it is not only a critical factor of production resilient to waves of industrial and technological revolution but has also been pivotal to global socioeconomic transformations labour is the only factor of production that serves a dual role both as an input in production and as a consumer influencing the demand for production this criticality of labour has largely remained unchanged even in the wake of watershed moments in the global industrial order the first industrial revolution led to a shift in labour force from primary to secondary sectors as the invention of steam engine boosted labour productivity by significantly lowering the dependence on manual labour the second and third industrial revolution pivotal on technological innovation further increased the demand for skilled labour in the current context while digital disruption and automation has enhanced labour productivity labour in turn has been driving such innovation critical thinking and decision making on the one hand technological progress has enhanced labour productivity by largely eliminating low end jobs streamlining tasks and processes and enabling workers to generate more output with the same level of man hours meanwhile on the other labour by the virtue of its human intelligence creativity critical thinking and agility has been at the forefront of this technology revolution thus in this ever changing landscape the role of labour is increasingly becoming more complex and essential in aiding economic output 01 labour as a global resource the relationship between labour and technology is more complementary than substitutive with each playing an indispensable role in supporting economic momentum the essence of this relationship has been underscored in the endogenous economic growth model 2 which considers labour as a complementary input to technology in production 1 2 international labour migration as a leveller international labour migration has been a crucial factor in shaping economies societies and cultures across the globe throughout history beginning with the establishment of maritime trade routes centuries ago to the expansion of global networks in the modern times global labour migration continues to influence geopolitical developments as well as the socioeconomic fabric across the globe in the current context global labour migration is an important concern driven by a slew of economic social geopolitical and cultural factors this section discusses the current trends in global labour migration 2 paul m romer endogenous technological change journal of

regional perspective north america europe and the gulf countries are the most preferred destination for migrant workers due to better economic opportunities political stability and higher living standards conversely regions experiencing conflict economic hardship or environmental challenges are seeing higher emigration rates india s role in international labour migration india holds a unique position in the narrative of international labour migration the phenomenon of global emigration of indian has deeper historical roots and has been constantly evolving in response to global economic and geopolitical dynamics economic factors played an important role in shaping india s labour emigration patterns the oil boom in the middle east during 1970 1980 led to a plethora of economic opportunities in the construction and low skilled services sector this led to a significant immigration of indian labour to the gulf countries there was also a significant increase in the emigration of highly skilled labour to developed countries like the us canada the united kingdom and australia in sectors such as medicine healthcare information technology it and engineering the period witnessed a sizable emigration of indian medical professionals to the us due to the expanding healthcare sector in the country as along with the implementation of several favourable immigration policies furthermore the booming it sector in the us during the 1990s also attracted high skilled indian it professionals the period saw many indians driven by better economic opportunities and living standards seeking permanent residency or citizenship in the us in the recent decades on the one hand gulf countries are largely attracting unskilled and semi skilled indian labour due to the high demand for labour in the region s fast expanding infrastructure and construction sectors and low end services and on the other hand developed economies like the us canada and countries of the european union have been a popular location for highly skilled indian labour migrants in the coming years as global labour force migration may continue to increase india s international labour migration landscape is poised to evolve further in response to technological evolution enhanced digital connectivity climate changes and demographic transitions global demand for skilled labour is expected to strengthen offering enhanced opportunities for indian labour in emerging sectors like artificial intelligence renewable energy and biotechnology data from international labour organisation ilo reveals that as of 2019 total international migrant workers across the globe stood at 169 million accounting for 4 9 of the global labour force from a gender perspective there were 99 million male workers and

further equip its labour force with the necessary skills to meet global demand ensuring india s continued contribution to global labour migration 1 3 structural shifts in global labour migration global labour migration patterns have witnessed disruptive changes in the last decade largely driven by rapid changes in technology the confluence of emerging technologies like ai big data internet of things iot and blockchain computing coined under the umbrella of the fourth industrial revolution industry 4 0 has led to paradigm changes in the labour market landscape worldwide there has been an increasing trend in de linking of labour from its services a shift away from traditional long term location based labour employment to task based service delivery that can be performed by a labour virtually without the need of any physical presence aided by the digital wave the rise of gig economy freelancing and part time work and emergence of digital platforms enabled outsourcing of jobs mainly contract based tasks to a large global workforce beyond geographical boundaries this helped skilled workers in developing economies in pursuit of higher income opportunities to access global jobs from a remote location without the need of any physical movement thus eliminating the existing geographical and geopolitical constraints this de linking of labour and its services has helped in increasing the outreach and employability of global labour force thus offering businesses access to a much wider global labour pool and providing workers a global market for their skills the covid 19 pandemic and the consequent lockdowns which led to disruptions in economic activity further strengthened this transformation remote working practices increased sharply in low contact intensive sectors like professional services and information technology during this period however its noteworthy that the trend of remote work in some of the sectors has persisted even in the post pandemic period figure 4 shows a sharp increase in jobs that can be performed remotely as percentage of total jobs in the us this was triggered by the widespread lockdowns after the covid 19 pandemic the share decreased in 2022 as economic activity and business operations moved towards normalcy resulting in many workers resuming working from offices particularly in more labour intensive sectors despite the decline the share of remotely performed work in 2022 remained significantly higher than the pre pandemic levels highlighting a more structural shift underway this change in work and employment pattern has also led to a structural transformation in migration patterns wherein labour would offer its services to businesses across geographical borders without the need of any physical movement figure 4

2019 2021 2022 source u s bureau of labor statistics the rise in remote work since the pandemic and its impact on productivity this trend in global labour migration will likely sustain as digital jobs and remote working opportunities continue to gain traction 5 according to a world economic forum report businesses expect around 42 of all tasks to be automated by the year 2027 6 similarly according to another report digital jobs are expected to increase by around 25 by 2030 thus creating huge disruptions in the global labour market 7 these trends underscore a cohesive mix of increasing job opportunities in emerging and high skill domains with a gradual phasing out of several existing low and medium skilled manual tasks that will likely be automated thus while low end tasks the ones which employ unskilled and low skilled labour including migrant labour may decline high skill jobs are likely to gain prominence thus facilitating greater migration of niche skills and expertise across countries particularly developed economies with thriving service sector will continue to attract skilled labour but the increasing possibilities of delinking of labour and its services will likely result in migration of skills across the globe without cross border physical movement of labour professional scientific and technical services information technology finance and insurance

the case for global workforce migration a strategic blueprint to harness india s demographic dividend 9 while the emergence of a wide spectrum of new job roles offers increased opportunities for the labour force it also brings with it new challenges for example gig work may involve irregular and out of routine working hours irregular payment short term contracts wage discrimination and in several cases no job security this is largely due to the evolving nature of such jobs and the absence of well crafted labour regulations pertaining to the same therefore it is crucial to adopt a holistic policy approach to these structural changes a detailed understanding of the evolving trends in global labour demand and supply and migration patterns is key to the effective formulation of future migration policies across countries adapting policies including revising work visa requirements revamping hiring process for skilled migrants and designing a facilitating labour migration framework may help in addressing the current challenges and manage this transition well 1 4 challenges and opportunities in global labour markets global labour markets are facing a myriad of challenges economic volatility informal employment and underemployment skill mismatches demographic shifts and wage compression are some of the issues that warrant well designed mitigating measures however on the brighter side opportunities related to technological progress remote working alternatives move towards sustainable growth and focus on up skilling are plenty leveraging these opportunities would require supportive policies favourable regulatory framework and international cooperation to ensure a robust resilient and inclusive global labour markets the following section discusses some of the key trends which pose challenges and if leveraged well can translate into opportunities for global labour migration unemployment and underemployment the global labour market is fragmented and diverse with low and middle income countries coping with high unemployment levels while high income countries are facing labour shortages in many sectors while global unemployment rate stood at 5 1 in 2023 well below the pre pandemic levels there are huge underlying disparities high income countries have an unemployment rate of 4 5 compared to 5 7 in low income countries 8 supportive frameworks facilitating cross border labour migration could help reduce these imbalances providing socioeconomic benefits to both the migrant sending as well as the receiving countries and optimising employment levels worldwide skills mismatch any gap between workers skills and job requirements results in underemployment and inefficiencies weighing on economic growth and innovation a report by world economic forum reveals that 60 of companies outlined local skills gaps as a major barrier to transformation and 53 struggle to attract talent 9 demographic shifts the proportion of older workers aged 55 to 64 in the global labour force has been on a steady rise and is likely to increase further till 2030 this trend is predominant in both emerging and developed economies where older workers is expected to account for 13 2 and 17 7 of the total workforce respectively this is sharply higher than the share of 7 9 in developing economies 10 thus while developed economies are facing demographic challenges most of the developing economies are reaping the benefits of having a relatively younger population offering a potential demographic dividend global migration and productive employment of young labour from labour rich developing economies to the advanced economies witnessing labour shortages can help rejuvenate their workforces and support economic output and sustainable growth undocumented migration and labour markets undocumented migration is increasingly undermining legal migration frameworks adversely impacting public resources triggering anti migration sentiments and resulting in restrictive immigration policies the conflation of regular and irregular migration in political dialogue has exacerbated negative public perceptions resulting in regulatory frameworks and policies that make legal migration more bureaucratic expensive and difficult even when host countries face labour shortages in high skills sectors like healthcare and technology governments must balance national security concerns with economic needs by implementing more transparent migration policies which can facilitate legal migration additionally international dialogue and cooperation is essential to address the critical issue of forced migration to ensure that labour migration helps in achieving shared prosperity across the globe technological and structural shifts remote working practices and emergence of digital jobs have reshaped the global labour landscape bringing in paradigm changes the automation of low skilled tasks has weighed on demand for low skilled labour but at the same time has generated many high skilled and specialised jobs creating opportunities for cross border skill migration by adequately capitalising this technological change identifying key skill areas and providing quality skills trainings countries can foster a more skilled inclusive and empowered global workforce leveraging labour migration for global economic and social enhancement the global labour market is going through a transformative phase driven by a plethora of technological demographic socioeconomic and geopolitical factors adequately understanding these changes addressing the imminent challenges and leveraging the opportunities requires collaboration between governments policy makers private sector educational institutions and the society at large to foster inclusive equitable and supportable labour market policies 8 ilo world employment and social outlook trends 2024 1st ed 9 world economic forum the future of jobs report 2023 10 harasty c ostermeier m 2020 population ageing

includes individuals who move for different reasons for example better economic opportunities family reunification education or fleeing geopolitical conflict meanwhile focusing on labour aspect of migration the international labour organization ilo defines a labour migrant as a person who is to be engaged or has been engaged in a remunerated activity in a state of which he or she is not a national 12 labour migration is a substantial part of global migration driven by the demand for labour across different geographic regions and sectors labour migration can be influenced by a slew of economic or non economic factors this section discusses the evolution of theoretical frameworks of global migration assessing the drivers of migration and providing evidence of their empirical veracity migration drivers can be broadly categorised into two factors push and pull push factors are conditions which influence people to leave their home region or workplace while pull factors are attributes of a destination that attract workers to migrate to that area low wages economic instability geopolitical conflicts poor social benefits are some of the most common push factors 02 benefits of global workforce migration similarly higher wages attractive welfare programmes political stability better working conditions in the destination region are pull factors which can motivate workers to migrate migration decisions are also influenced by the relative difference in expected utility which is affected by both push and pull factors the following section discusses how economic theory has conceptualised migration evolving from the neoclassical framework to broader heterodox frameworks early economic models from the classical school considered population growth as a binding constraint for economic progress due to limited resources land in particular however the economic boom in the immigrant receiving countries like the us canada and australia in the 9th century contradicted this school of through highlighting that immigration aids growth rather than hindering it as economic thought evolved the neoclassical school particularly through the solow growth model13 highlighted the importance of technological progress as the key driver of long term economic growth the model also underscores the crucial role of human capital in enhancing a country s technological capabilities and growth potential this framework remains highly relevant in the current context wherein technology adoption and innovation are key to continuing competitiveness and migration of skilled workers has been at the fulcrum of global labour migration 11 united nations global issues international migration 12 united nations convention on the protection of the rights of all migrant workers and members of their families 1990 article 2 1 13 note solow model is a neoclassical model of economic growth developed by robert m solow in 1957 the solow growth model shows how capital

assumed that native born and immigrant are competitors if they are complementary to each other wage in fact might increase empirical evidence shows that there is null or slightly positive impact on wage and employment on native workers due to immigration hence this model highlights that even when we assume negative impact in labour market of destination countries there is larger global gain to achieve through free flow of labour migration 19 anthony edo 2019 the impact of immigration on the labour market journal of economic surveys volume33 issue3 the later models of labour migration like the one conceptualised by harris and todaro 14 further explain some of the current migration dynamics unlike traditional models which assume that migration would stop once wage differences are eliminated this framework considers other factors such as employment probability and urban rural disparities to provide a more thorough understanding of why migration may persist even when wage gaps are minimised in today s world labour migration is driven not just by wage differentials but also by factors like employment opportunities expected wage differences rather than actual quality of life access to healthcare and education and social and political stability the endogenous growth model15 highlights the significance of skilled migrants in complementing technology and driving innovation as a reflection recent migration policies in many countries have increasingly prioritised attracting skilled talent additional theories also explain the evolving migration patterns for instance the dual or segmented labour market theory16 highlights how macroeconomic aspects such as industrial transformations in developed countries create pull factors for migration the world systems theory17 illustrates how developed countries seek labour from developing regions shaping global migration routes while the contemporary economic theories may differ in their theoretical essence they largely highlight that labour migration is driven by a range of multifaceted factors beyond wage differences and that industrial and technology changes and established migrant communities play a key role in determining and sustaining global migration patterns while boosting economic growth 2 2 an economic framework of global labour migration to understand how free flow of labour migration from labour endowed economy to labour deficit economy can boost global economic welfare we look at a basic economic model of global labour migration the model assumes free cross border movement of labour across the world as labour migration increases the increased labour supply in the destination country results in a reduction in wages there 18 while the reduced supply in the origin country leads to wage increases 19 immigrants benefit from higher wages in the destination country compared to the origin country and domestic workers in the origin country see wage growth due to fewer workers source taken from book cynthia bansak zebedee nicole simpson madeline zavodny 2020 the economics of immigration 2nd edition routledge figure 5 depicts the labour market graphs for both the destination and origin countries the vertical axis on the left side shows the wage in the destination country while the vertical axis on the right side shows the wage in the origin country the horizontal axis measures the number of workers in the destination from left to right and the number of workers in the origin from right to left the stock of labour across both countries is represented by l full length of the horizontal axis in each country labour demand is driven by the value of workers marginal product the demand for labour is greater in the destination country than in the origin country as indicated by the higher vertical intercept of dd compared to do this shows that workers are more productive in the destination country although native born workers in the destination country may experience a

zavodny 2020 the economics of immigration 2nd edition routledge as is evident from the model there is a global gain achieved by moving labour across borders businesses and enterprises in the destination countries tend to reap substantial benefits from labour immigration which can be reinvested to further expand capacity and output in subsequent periods this expansion in turn continues to attract more migrants in a scenario of unrestricted global labour movement this cycle perpetuates and accelerates economic growth for both the origin and destination countries thus enhancing the overall growth potential of the global economy 2 3 benefits of labour migration this section discusses the empirical evidence of the benefits and positive spillovers of global labour migration substantiating the theoretical framework discussed in the previous section workforce migration offers a slew of benefits for both the destination as well as the origin country for the host economy it helps in bridging labour shortages and productivity differential cross border movement of skilled workers enables transfer of knowledge to host economies which boosts innovation and global competitiveness for the origin country labour migration ensures a steady inflow of remittances income a crucial tool aiding in poverty alleviation and economic stability overall the diverse perspectives and experiences of migrant workers also help in fostering technological progress business dynamism and entrepreneurial excellence in the home country therefore the net gain from immigration is the area d e the breakdown of this gain is given in table 1 pre immigration equilibrium the pre immigration labour market equilibrium in the destination is l1 workers and wage wd in destination and lo l l1 workers and wage wo in the origin open global labour migration in a scenario of open labour migration workers relocate until wages are equal in both countries this equilibrium is reached at the point where the labour supply intersects with the labour demand in each country l workers continue to move until the wages in both countries are equalised resulting in wd wo w at equilibrium the wage in the destination country decreases from wd to w conversely in the origin country the wage increases from wo to w while the theoretical model is based on an assumption of no labour migration barriers in reality the existence of geopolitical and social barriers has hindered wage equalisation in many regions particularly between low and high income countries gain for the immigrant immigrants benefit by earning higher wage due to labour migration immigrant workers gain areas e and i before migrating they earned area j but after migration their income increases to e i j gain loss for the destination native born workers in the destination country are disadvantaged because their wages decrease prior to immigration these workers earned areas b c however after immigration their earnings drop to just area c meanwhile other production factors in the destination like capital owners initially earn area a following immigration their earnings increase to a b d gain loss for origin country in the origin country wages rise due to the outflow of workers before immigration the workers who stay behind those who do not migrate earn area h after immigration their earnings increase to g h resulting in a gain of area g initially other production factors in the origin country earn f g i but after immigration their earnings decrease to area f pwc making the case for global workforce migration a strategic blueprint to harness india s demographic dividend 13 labour migration due to difference in wage rates can generate an overall larger pie for the economy and easing immigration restriction can be an effective way to reduce global income disparities a study argues that the potential gains from easing immigration restrictions could be much higher than that from easing barriers to trade or capital flows the estimated gains from eliminating barriers to labour mobility could result in gains ranging from 50 to 150 of world gdp much higher than the expected gains from removing cross border trade and capital flow barriers 20 the broader economic gains from labour migration are encapsulated below skills and innovation global labour migration contributes to skill enhancement and innovation by attracting diverse talent and highly skilled labour to host countries high skilled migrants especially in stem fields aid patent activity and technological innovations for instance a 1 point increase in the share of immigrant college graduates in the us correlates with a 15 rise in patents per capita 21 while foreign born inventors make up 16 of the us

disguised worker in origin this demographic boost is essential for aging societies that need a steady influx of younger workers to sustain economic growth in regions like latin america and the caribbean where the population aged 60 and older is projected to double by 2050 labour migration is crucial for sustaining economic and social vitality 28 remittances world bank s report reveals a significant rise in international remittances from usd 128 billion in 2000 to usd 857 billion in 2023 low and middle income countries are the primary beneficiaries of remittance flows while high income countries like the us saudi arabia and switzerland are the main sources of remittances in 2023 india mexico china the philippines and pakistan were the top five recipient countries for remittances inflows 29 economic growth global labour migration has been a strong driver of economic growth both for the destination as well as the origin economy migrants contribute sizably to their host countries gdp through increased labour force participation labour productivity innovations entrepreneurship and consumption while also sending remittances that boost their home countries

data portal a closer look at the episodes characterised by large waves of immigration suggests positive economic impact of labour migration on destination countries a study by imf estimates that a 1 point increase in the inflow of immigrants relative to total employment in advanced economies increases output by almost 1 by the fifth year 30 furthermore a simulation exercise conducted by the imf for the period from 2020 to 2050 shows that while the growth in the native population is likely to increase global gdp by roughly 4 from the baseline between 2020 and 2050 labour migration flows could contribute to an additional 2 to global growth 31 thus the economic benefits of labour migration are manifold substantially impacting global and regional economies high skilled migrants enhance innovation and entrepreneurship evidenced by their substantial contributions to patents and business startups in countries like the us remittances from migrants which surged to usd 857 billion globally in 2023 32 play a critical role in supporting economies in low and middle income countries overall global labour migration has positive impacts on economic growth with studies signalling that

strategic blueprint to harness india s demographic dividend 22 the following section highlights global migration trends based on five key barriers which are impacting global workforce mobility and migration 4 1 lack of institutional frameworks for enhancing safe smooth and regular migration strong institutional frameworks are important to monitor migration movements between the origin and destination countries when bilateral relations are strong between the nations issues faced by the immigrants are streamlined through effected channels thereby facilitating the requirements of both host and destination countries as the immigrant s concerns are steadily catered to some examples which highlight the impact of weak institutional frameworks are 04 barriers to global workforce mobility 45 international labour organization ilo policy coherence and labour migration accessed january 21 2025 46 cholewinski ryszard 2015 evaluating bilateral labour migration agreements in the light of human and labour rights in the palgrave handbook of international labour migration edited by marion panizzon gottfried z rcher and elisa fornal 231 252 london palgrave macmillan 47 tiwari

agreements blmas 45 this impacts administering regular migration facilitating effective readmission as well as economic and social relations between nations 46 1 low priority for inclusion of mobility arrangements agenda in free trade agreements ftas while various countries are pursuing inclusion of mobility agreements in their respective contracts e g india has pursued mutual recognition agreements mras in multiple agreements to foster their service suppliers recognition for professional services across sectors however these need to be established universally without these mras the possible gains from ftas can be affected particularly affected the mobility of immigrants to move across borders 2 absence of social security agreements ssas these impact accessibility of essential social security benefits by the immigrants thereby affecting their integration in the destination countries 47 these may be further accentuated by restrictive legal modalities and low awareness among immigrants 48 3 pwc making the case for global workforce migration a strategic blueprint to harness india s demographic dividend 23 4 2 lack of a common international reference framework each country has its own unique skilling framework and workforce requirements shaped by their socio economic priorities one of the challenges which emerges with global workforce migration is streamlining and benchmarking the existing skillsets of the workforce in both destination and host countries this can be further complicated in situations wherein international reference frameworks are not available for individuals this results in significant wage penalties and low returns in investments with respect to their educational qualifications while businesses are impacted in terms of turnover and workforce productivity this highlights the emergent need to adapt a common international reference framework globally to cater to the emerging global skill gaps and enhance labour mobility ilo 2023 49 4 3 barriers emerging out of cultural diversities it has been observed that migrants face issues in integration due to low understanding of the cultures in the destination countries in cases where cultural sensitivity training is not covered in pre departure trainings due to limited proficiency in linguistic standards communication is also affected both at the personal and professional front employers are also reluctant to hire workforce who have low fluency in the local language in the destination country as this could impact work and increase the possibility of errors and conflicts at workplace this is perceived as discrimination at the time of hiring process by immigrants affecting their accessibility to their employment and successful integration 4 4 channels for high cost remittances remittances emerge as an important channel for foreign exchange earnings across many low and middle income countries lmics in the asia and pacific region and have an impact on the household incomes and overall livelihood including life quality this trend has increased significantly after the covid 19 pandemic as foreign direct investments flow has slowed in lmics 50 however there exists a high cost for sending remittances by many migrants which acts as a barrier primarily in developing regions in the fourth quarter of 2023 the global average cost of sending usd 200 was 6 4 which is 0 2 percentage points higher than the previous year and more than double the target set by the sustainable development goal 10 c 1 of reducing remittance costs to 3 this significantly points towards the barriers existing in achieving lucrative remittance transfers globally 51 according to the analysis of key channels for sending remittances globally most expensive are the banks due to complex processes which at times are outdated and involves intermediary as well as conversion charges as per the respective currency while comparatively less costly options are post offices and money transfer operators mtos average costs 7 7 and 5 5 respectively 52 money transfer operators stands somewhere in middle while being affordable comparatively with post office here mobile operators emerged as the cheapest alternative this trend points towards the increase in the usage of mobile money services which provide speedy transfers and low operational costs in comparison to other channels this may be further strengthened with enhancing scalability and internal availability particularly in remote areas for mass adoption 4 5 two pronged impact of lottery of birth lottery of birth 53 plays an important role in deciding migration success although migrant s personal capabilities and environment nurture their aspirations to a large extent this can impact workforce migration in two ways displaced populations and the population affected by ineffective migration structures and processes due to lack of collaborative efforts by the relevant stakeholders in the migration set up potential migrants are impacted due to complex migration processes some of the challenges related to this are navigating visa processes and legal regulations failure to secure a work visa and valid

is well positioned to address the shortfalls in the labour markets of many advanced economies with a population exceeding 1 4 billion nearly 65 of which are of working age 15 64 years and over 27 aged 15 to 24 india s relatively young demographic profile has the potential to create a significant positive impact on the global labour market as one of the world s fastest growing large economy india boasts a gdp growth rate of 8 2 in 2023 24 driven by strong private consumption and public investments as a result the country is now on track to achieve its ambitious target of becoming a usd 5

speaking highly skilled workforce is a critical asset which contributes to the economies of destination countries a substantial wealth of resources and ai skill penetration three times the global average positions india as a prominent contender in this transformative field 55 05 leveraging india s demographic dividend heavy investments in ai research and skilling programmes coupled with initiatives such as the pradhan mantri kaushal vikas yojana pmkvy the skill india mission and digital india aims to uplift millions by providing internationally standardised education and training india s growing interest in developing and promoting regional and global economic partnerships underscores its readiness to facilitate the flow of skilled labour for instance germany s strategic focus on expanding mobility agreements highlights india s capacity to meet the demands of digital and green economies 56 similarly india s collaboration with japan under the specified skilled worker programme addresses japan s labour shortages by empowering individuals for global opportunities 57 the global labour landscape is witnessing significant demographic transitions owing to a substantial decline in population growth rates in advanced economies and therefore a surge in their dependency ratios countries like germany italy japan and south korea are grappling with shrinking working age populations leading to commensurate reductions in labour supply and employment rates and a slowdown in gdp growth rates for instance in the eu projections indicate that the contribution of labour supply to economic growth will turn negative as hours worked decrease 58 54 https pib gov in pressreleaseshare aspx prid 1549454 soumya bhowmick bridging global workforce gaps an indian perspective

population exemplify this trend these demographic shifts result in a lower human capital pool and reduced labour productivity undermining the prospects of long term economic resilience while automation and ai offer complementary solutions they still serve as a piecemeal approach to addressing the nuanced challenges posed by ageing societies these dynamics underline the urgency for global labour mobility where labour endowed nations like india can supply skilled workers to labour scarce economies fostering mutual economic growth and resilience in 2024 the united arab emirates uae engaged in discussions with india to finalise migration and mobility agreements focusing on the welfare of indian workers and enhancing consular cooperation streamlining visa processes and promoting greater people to people exchanges have been highlighted as critical imperatives to leverage india s capacity to meet the demands of evolving economic sectors 59 similarly australia and india co signed the migration and mobility partnership arrangement mmpa in may 2023 which includes the mobility arrangement for talented early professionals scheme mates this scheme facilitates the mobility of graduates and early career professionals particularly in sectors like renewable energy mining engineering and information technology highlighting india s role in supplying skilled talent for australia s digital and green economies 60 with a 20 increase in migrating indian workers over the past five years the indian government is developing a national migration policy to protect the rights of these workers streamline their mobility and ensuring access to welfare resources 61 the union budget 2024 prioritised skilling education financial support infrastructure development and health services with an aim to create a workforce that is not only large but also highly skilled productive and capable of meeting global standards as the only country where the workforce supply is growing faster than the demand india is a hub for organisations which are seeking trained professionals and for professionals who are seeking dynamic career opportunities the opportunity is particularly ripe in labour intensive industries and sectors like technology and healthcare where india s workforce demonstrates remarkable skill readiness developed countries benefit from cost efficiencies and economies of scale by hiring indian labour at relatively lower costs even after accounting for relocation expenses while india gains from remittances lower unemployment rates and enhanced human capital however as india continues to deal with the imperative for creating jobs especially for the youth it is also prompting the government to view employment based migration as a strategic pathway to reduce domestic unemployment while aligning with global labour demands this dual approach can address skill mismatches within the country and also ensure that india s growing workforce contributes effectively to global markets recent trends reveal a shift in the preferences of indian workers seeking opportunities abroad the uae is no longer the top destination with australia the us canada germany and the uk emerging as favoured choices additionally countries like the netherlands and new zealand are gaining favour due to inclusive immigration policies flexible work visas and abundant career progression opportunities 62 however challenges related to workforce mobility persist systems supporting labour mobility often fall short of achieving their intended outcomes due to negative public perceptions anti immigrant sentiments and restrictive immigration policies in many high income countries cultural issues complex immigration processes and inadequate social protection or support systems exacerbate the situation the covid 19 pandemic further impacted migrant workers particularly those in low skilled jobs leading to job losses and financial distress 59 shashank singh india uae progress

candidates 63 moreover variability in the quality of education and vocational training results in transferable skill gaps which fail to meet the requirements of destination countries india specific challenges compound these broader issues a lack of robust domestic frameworks that can efficiently manage outbound migration often results in unregulated intermediaries exploiting aspiring workers additionally the uneven distribution of skilling programmes across states creates disparities in employability with rural and marginalised communities facing limited access to these opportunities despite efforts to improve language training and cultural adaptation programmes these initiatives often remain underfunded and poorly implemented furthermore inadequate tracking mechanisms for indian workers abroad hinder the ability to address grievances and ensure their welfare leaving many migrant workers vulnerable to exploitation and unsafe working conditions 64 demographic theory particularly dependency ratio illustrates the growing challenges advanced economies face due to ageing populations by 2050 the working age population in many high income countries is expected to shrink by over 92 million while the elderly population 65 and older will grow by more than 100 million 65 this imbalance strains public finances social security and healthcare systems creating an urgent demand for over 400 million new workers in the next 30 years 66 india s alignment of its labour supply with the needs of these economies can address this crisis fostering mutual economic growth

measuring sustainability and equity august 2023 historically economic models treated labour primarily as a flow variable measured in terms of time engaged in production while capital was seen as a stock variable accumulated and used over time this approach while useful often failed to explain disparities in labour productivity across regions or sectors the concept of human capital emerged as a corrective measure recognising that workforce quality encompassing education skills and health plays a crucial role in augmenting the productivity of labour for example workers with higher educational attainment or specialised training contribute more effectively to economic output than those with limited skills even when working similar hours human capital is therefore distinct from labour while labour refers to the total hours worked human capital reflects the quality of those hours shaped by factors such as schooling vocational training and healthcare conceptually human capital is akin to a stock variable similar to physical capital representing the cumulative investments in people over time this aligns with un s sustainable development goals sdgs 1 5 and 8 which underscore the need for equity efficiency and sustainability in workforce development 72 investing in human capital addresses critical challenges such as poverty unemployment and hunger while fostering sustainable economic growth for instance enhanced skilling and education reduces reliance on natural ecosystems for livelihoods especially in rural areas thereby supporting environmental conservation 73 this dynamic is evident in parts of the global south where overdependence on natural ecosystems has strained resources and impeded development by equipping workers with skills and knowledge human capital development reduces ecosystem dependency contributing to environmental sustainability and resilience measuring human capital and its impact requires robust data and nuanced approaches while indicators like school enrolment rates and average years of schooling offer insights more sophisticated methods such as the cost approach valuing investments in education and health or the income approach estimating returns on these investments are essential to gauge human capital s contribution to economic growth according to the unep inclusive wealth report 2023 human capital constitutes the largest share of inclusive wealth globally despite its slower growth compared to physical capital 74 notably low income economies have recorded significant gains in human capital due to population growth and educational improvements while high income countries continue to dominate in absolute terms labour mobility presents a pathway to enhance global equity and productivity projections indicate that low income countries will have two billion new working age individuals by 2050 connecting such workers with employers in advanced economies can significantly boost incomes and help in alleviating poverty as workers can expect salary increases of 6 to 15 times 70 for india as well as for other countries to leverage this potential improving the quality of its labour force to meet global standards is imperative where country partnerships can address this issue achieving workforce readiness to meet global standards involves enhancing skills and simultaneously addressing educational quality healthcare access and language proficiency to prepare workers for competitive international markets despite the immense potential india s workforce faces significant challenges to fully capitalise on this demographic advantage including inadequate vocational training infrastructure mismatches between education outcomes and industry needs low female workforce participation and regulatory hurdles for overseas employment 71 countries like south korea and singapore are examples of how countries can efficiently harness their demographic dividends since by investing in universal education promoting a culture of lifelong learning and aligning policies with global economic demands these nations have transformed their youthful populations into highly productive workforces which have sustained high rates of economic growth india can draw lessons from these success stories while addressing its own unique challenges by aligning workforce development strategies with global needs indian and other countries with potential demographic dividends can be channelled by labour deficit countries which can play a transformative role in shaping the future of the international labour market driving mutual economic benefits for both the source and the destination countries 5 2 integrating human capital with labour productivity leveraging india s demographic dividend india s demographic advantage can only be fully realised by enhancing the productivity of its workforce through investments in human capital human capital refers to the accumulated skills knowledge and health of a workforce which collectively determines its productivity and potential economic contributions unlike traditional measures of labour productivity which focus solely on the number of hours worked or output per worker human capital integrates qualitative dimensions such as education skill development and health to assess a workforce s capacity pwc making the case for global workforce migration

capital accounted for the largest share of inclusive wealth globally between 1990 and 2019 despite slower growth compared to physical or produced capital 77 low income economies have recorded the most significant relative increases in human capital driven by population growth and educational improvements however high income countries still hold the largest absolute share of human capital within their inclusive wealth highlighting its critical role in overall economic resilience the covid 19 pandemic underscored the need for active labour market policies integrating education health and mid career training with broader workforce management strategies however similar to globalisation technological advancements and demographic shifts workforce migration has also emerged as an important factor for shaping global job markets a comprehensive understanding of a country s human capital stock is essential for effective policy making and workforce transition management however a persistent talent gap exists between developed and developing economies due to outdated education systems a report from world economic forum notes that secondary education systems meet employment needs at rates of 59 in advanced economies and 42 in emerging economies for tertiary education the rates are 68 in advanced economies and 55 in emerging economies 78 in addition to education factors such as inadequate resources limited migration networks and insufficient access to technology also contribute significantly to the global talent gap even in developed countries disparities in skill acquisition persist due to regional inequalities and socio economic barriers for instance a report from the world economic forum highlights that access to quality training programmes and digital infrastructure often remains uneven impeding inclusive workforce development 79 addressing these multifaceted challenges requires a holistic approach beyond education including equitable resource allocation and improved labour mobility networks 5 4 replicable public and private sector intervention models for workforce mobility in india workforce mobility has become a global priority as nations grapple with demographic transitions skill shortages and evolving job markets advanced economies like germany japan and canada are implementing robust migration policies to attract skilled talent addressing their ageing populations and labour deficits the indian government s strategic focus on human capital development is evident in policies prioritising education healthcare and skill enhancement initiatives like the ayushman bharat yojana and the national education policy aim to improve workforce health and education while programmes such as skill india international centres ensure global competitiveness these investments enhance individual well being and strengthen the nation s economic resilience against systemic shocks india ranks 116th among 174 countries in the human capital index 2020 with a score of 0 49 up from 0 44 in 2018 the disparity between urban and rural education is stark with 57 5 of urban residents completing secondary education compared to 30 6 in rural areas similarly higher education completion rates stand at 21 7 in urban areas versus 5 7 in rural areas 75 while india performs better than the global average on the gender inequality index health and education expenditure gaps persist in a rapidly changing global economy aligning human capital development with labour market demands is paramount by bridging gaps in education skills and health india has the potential to transform its youthful demographic into a globally competitive workforce 5 3 bridging the global talent gap the global workforce is a mix of workers with strong educational qualifications valuable skill sets and a commitment to lifelong learning along with people who do not meet the criteria in the context of rapid technological change and the rise of ai

to strengthen school education infrastructure and delivery additionally the urban learning internship programme offers hands on experience to young professionals bridging the gap between academic learning and workforce demands these initiatives aim to address disparities in human capital development by enhancing access to education training and healthcare particularly in rural and underserved areas by ensuring transparency and accountability in their implementation the government seeks to maximise the effectiveness of these programmes the global workforce landscape is evolving with workers demanding higher wages and greater meaning from their work this has renewed emphasis on skill first hiring approaches to address labour shortages by quantifying the value of skill development initiatives firms can justify training expenditures relative to workers productivity and wage growth integrating career progression plans with human capital investments can mitigate turnover rates incentivise productivity and foster a sustainable workforce such strategies are essential for optimising talent in highly mobile labour markets as technological demographic and economic transformations accelerate the need for a globally competitive workforce has never been greater by aligning education and skill development with labour market demands nations can bridge talent gaps and foster inclusive growth for india the focus must remain on leveraging its demographic dividend through sustained investments in human capital this approach will enable india to navigate workforce transitions effectively ensuring sustainable economic growth and resilience in a rapidly changing global environment enriching human capital resources involves increasing the number of skilled workers and ensuring that their productivity aligns with global standards achieving this requires a strategic focus on education skill development health and overall well being in many countries functional constraints such as information asymmetries coordination failures among industry stakeholders financial pressures and negative externalities hinder the effectiveness of skill based ecosystems governments play a pivotal role as facilitators guiding these ecosystems to align with anticipated outcomes by becoming proactive orchestrators governments can ensure worker protection and economic growth critical interventions include building comprehensive digital skill platforms to address information asymmetry sustaining skilling investments through policy measures like tax exemptions or

by reskilling employees fostering entrepreneurship and linking labour markets across borders training programmes tailored to industry needs not only benefit companies by addressing skill gaps but also empower workers to secure long term employment additionally private firms contribute to mobility through environmentally sustainable practices like flexible working models and collaborating with governments to establish fair labour and immigration policies focusing on employee growth and development creates positive spillovers for organisations making workforce mobility a profitable scenario india s youthful workforce positions the country favourably in the global talent pool however challenges such as skill mismatches regulatory hurdles and gaps in mobility policies persist an evaluation of the indian diaspora reveals strengths in its educated and mobile labour force but also highlights the need for better infrastructure and policy frameworks to maximise potential recent labour market analyses underscore an opportunity for india to align its workforce capabilities with global demand filling sector specific skill shortages in the healthcare it and construction industries achieving this alignment requires addressing both supply side factors such as education and training and demand side factors such as sectoral deficiencies and migration policies a combined effort by governments and the private sector can ensure that india s labour surplus is effectively leveraged to meet global workforce needs strengthening these partnerships will help build a resilient interconnected economy while reinforcing india s position as a critical contributor to the global workforce pwc making the case for global workforce migration a strategic blueprint to harness india s demographic dividend 32 global workforce mobility extends beyond just the forces of international labour markets facilitating migration patterns across regions it encompasses the organised movement of human capital across international borders to fill skill and labour shortages in host nations leading to relative wage share equalisation across borders 81 the interaction of pureplay labour economics with international relations underpins such mobility which is essential for sustainable global economic growth especially in an interconnected world where demographic disparities are becoming increasingly apparent india among other countries with younger populations with a significant increase in its labour force from 396 3 million in 2000 to 567 4 million in 2022 and a relative increase in its workforce has a ready supply of individuals seeking better employment opportunities 82 when facilitated strategically this surplus can meet the demand generated by advanced economies experiencing worker shortages advanced economies structural rigidities and protectionist policies however complicate this simple supply demand match thus countries with younger populations must approach workforce mobility thoughtfully exploring diversified models that address specific sectoral and national needs while respecting immigration constraints skill requirements and local cultural factors 06 models of workforce mobility having discussed the significant demographic opportunity of india s workforce its abundant labour supply and prospects to capitalise upon it this chapter delves deeper into exploring the institutional arrangements which will be necessary to navigate the supply and demand dynamics of international labour markets towards an equilibrium including the criteria for defining the target sectors for such workers in the destination countries and the global workforce mobility frameworks that can facilitate smooth workforce migration integration and reintegration if needed to maximise the economic benefits for both countries as well as the social well being of the workers 81 according to the heckscher ohlin ho model of international trade countries export resources in this case labour they have in abundance and import the resources less abundant to benefit from their comparative advantage see ronald w jones heckscher ohlin trade theory the new palgrave dictionary of

workers are in demand in germany business standard october 18 2024 6 1 global hotspots for workforce mobility at the outset drawing upon discussions in the previous sections the criteria for selecting global hotspots for workforce mobility necessitates identifying countries and sectors where job opportunities are concentrated labour demand is abundant relative to its supply and policy environments are amenable to immigration in categorical terms the criteria for global hotspots therefore include the following countries with multicultural societies are generally more receptive to foreign workers promoting inclusivity in a socially cohesive environment for example germany s plan to expand language courses both in india and for workers who are already there shows potential and intent towards attracting more workers from india to address its labour scarcity 86 on the other hand nations with strong anti immigration sentiment may prefer alternative models such as off shore conclaves at this time easy regulatory policies open immigration frameworks and support for international workers play a key role in facilitating a smooth transition cultural and political receptiveness countries with liberal immigration policies and those confronting the pressures of relatively dependent demography are more likely to facilitate physical workforce mobility a research conducted by oecd highlights nations like canada and germany which have introduced policies to streamline skilled immigration as prime hotspots for mobility 85 understanding visa requirements employment restrictions and recognition of foreign qualifications is essential for maximising workforce integration for example the strict language proficiency requirements for immigrants in countries like france and japan and the limited multicultural support infrastructure have acted as significant barriers to the economic integration of foreign workers in these countries regulatory environment countries like japan germany and canada exhibit high demand in healthcare skilled trades and technology sectors influenced by high dependency ratios and a rapidly ageing population identifying these sectors allows india to target mobility programmes which are aligned with the workforce demands across skill levels in these host countries for instance as of 2023 almost 75 of us companies outsourced it services to india this resulted in significant revenue growth for these companies and made the us more competitive globally 83 similarly in 2023 blue collar migration from india to the middle east saw a 50 growth over the previous year with the uae s demand for skilled and non skilled workers in sectors like construction manufacturing and logistics witnessing a 25 and 15 rise respectively 84 labour demand in key sectors pwc making the case for global workforce migration a strategic blueprint to harness india s demographic dividend 34 india s strategy in workforce mobility must consider these assimilation dynamics focusing on supporting its workers through culturally adaptive training legal assistance for navigating employment rights and language programmes to facilitate communication and workplace harmony in host nations however assimilation and integration of foreign workers often confront challenges of their own highlighting the potential for other diverse institutional arrangements such as off shore conclaves or the guest workers model that can facilitate the indian workforce emerging as a global public good 6 2 1 model 1 on shore jobs the on shore jobs model envisions that indian workers can directly be assimilated into host countries labour markets contributing to their economies as resident employees this model is one of the most straightforward workforce mobility arrangements particularly suited to economies confronting demographic challenges and actively seeking to mitigate associated risks by facilitating workers immigration into their economies the on shore model aligns with several labour mobility theories notably the harris todaro model which posits that the expectation of higher wages and employment opportunities primarily drives rural to urban migration 90 when applied to international migration this model suggests that indian workers are likely to migrate to countries offering higher salaries and better living standards provided these countries have adequate job openings in specific sectors the wage differential incentivises mobility benefiting workers and the host country additionally the dual labour market theory91 separates the labour market into primary and secondary sectors to provide further insight primary sectors in advanced economies characterised by well paying stable jobs with career growth opportunities are increasingly difficult to fill due to shrinking native workforces indian workers can fulfil this demand especially in healthcare it and engineering allowing these sectors to remain competitive globally this model is therefore particularly suitable for several high demand sectors where workforce deficits are relatively pronounced india s robust education system and growing emphasis on upskilling position it as a global talent hub for instance the national skill development mission in india aims to skill over 400 million individuals by 2025 making indian workers particularly suitable for global markets 87 international organization for migration iom global compact for safe orderly and regular migration geneva iom 2024 accessed february 27 2025 88 gordon s theory of assimilation posits that immigrant groups undergo a multi stage process of assimilation into the host society progressing through stages such as acculturation structural integration intermarriage identification and civic assimilation but not necessarily in a linear or complete manner 89 milton m gordon assimilation in america theory and reality daedalus vol 90 no 2 ethnic groups in american

new jersey 2016 pp 1 3 6 2 workforce mobility frameworks and approaches identification of global hotspots is therefore crucial for formulating an effective workforce mobility strategy for india and other countries with younger populations such strategies can take the form of bilateral agreements which often create specific and mutually beneficial terms tailored to the needs of the partnering countries or multilateral frameworks which may involve multiple countries within a region each approach offers unique advantages and necessitates specific arrangements among partner countries while bilateral agreements provide flexibility focus on particular sectors and allow for streamlined processes such as faster recognition of qualifications and targeted visa types which ease workers transition into the host country s workforce multilateral models though more complex to negotiate offer scalability and can cover broader regions allowing indian workers access to several countries simultaneously for instance india s agreements with germany address specific skill requirements in healthcare and technology in contrast the global compact for migration 87 a un initiative promotes safe orderly and regular migration pathways which could provide a framework for regional agreements where labour can be integrated into europe or other collaborative regions beyond the specifics of immigration agreements successful workforce mobility depends on the frameworks underpinning these institutional arrangements that can ensure ease of migration and the assimilation and adaptability of workers in the host nation economic and sociological theories have extensively provided insights into this process for example gordon s theory of assimilation88 highlights the gradual integration of immigrants through stages beginning with economic integration followed by social and cultural assimilation 89 when foreign workers are both economically and socially accepted into host nations for on shore jobs they become more productive contributors to society economic models of assimilation also point to the importance of wage convergence where foreign workers wages eventually align with those of native workers in similar roles indicating full integration for workers achieving wage parity and career progression in host nations enhances their economic contribution while raising the overall productivity of the workforce pwc making the case for global workforce migration a strategic blueprint to harness india s demographic dividend 35 92 ministry of external affairs government of india

economies not just through labour but also as consumers stimulating growth particularly in under populated areas social benefits and integration workers enrich cultural diversity contribute to civic life and promote tolerance innovation and adaptability within host communities source orf analysis while the on shore model is economically promising it relies heavily on clear worker friendly immigration policies in host countries where several policy considerations come into play many skilled workers face challenges when their qualifications are not recognised abroad india s strategic agreements should advocate for streamlined certification processes and recognition of credentials in sectors like healthcare and it making it easier for skilled professionals to practise abroad it is also essential to ensure indian workers can access social benefits such as healthcare pensions and housing partnerships which guarantee equal treatment for foreign workers mitigate potential discrimination issues and ensure a more stable committed workforce but most importantly successful workforce integration requires pre departure training and skill alignment to meet host country standards india could implement or re envision its targeted training programmes tailored to the requirements of specific countries easing the transition and ensuring productivity from day one workers may also face cultural or language barriers affecting productivity and social integration host nations and indian agencies can collaborate on cultural and language training to ease this transition bilateral agreements can also be crucial in addressing credential recognition issues and ensuring social protection for indian workers streamlined certification processes negotiated through these agreements can help workers gain quicker access to their professions abroad pwc making the case for global workforce migration a strategic blueprint to harness india s demographic dividend 36 95

guide december 2023 table 8 opportunities of off shore conclaves for indian workers in target sectors additionally these agreements provisions for healthcare pensions and other social benefits can ensure that indian workers enjoy equitable treatment and stable livelihoods in host countries since immigration is a sensitive issue in many countries public opinion can influence policy therefore supplier country s approach should involve diplomatic engagement emphasising the economic contributions and social benefits of indian workers to local communities additionally reliance on a foreign workforce may expose host economies to vulnerabilities especially if immigration policies shift through bilateral or multilateral arrangements diversified workforce agreements can reduce dependence on a single source and encourage stable mobility surrounded by many opportunities the operationalisation of the on shore jobs model also necessitates that all supplier countries like india strike a delicate balance between the various frameworks for workforce mobility 6 2 2 model 2 off shore conclaves the off shore conclaves model represents a relatively novel approach to workforce mobility designed for countries facing demographic challenges but with strong reservations about permanent immigration or cultural integration of foreign workers in this model specialised working communities or conclaves are established within the host country but they operate semi autonomously often with restricted integration into the broader host society these conclaves allow workers to contribute to host economies while addressing potential security cultural or political concerns around immigration the off shore conclaves model requires rigorous planning cooperation and carefully structured agreements still it has the potential to serve as a flexible and scalable workforce mobility solution in regions with unique political or cultural constraints this model variant draws from the theories of economic geography and industrial clustering 95 where clusters or concentrated working environments enhance productivity by centralising talent resources and infrastructure instead of integrating directly into the wider society indian workers can perform specific roles in designated conclaves focusing on sectors experiencing labour shortages economic clustering of industries ensures that efficiencies arise from workers operating close to each other within sector specific ecosystems the off shore conclaves model also builds on the concept of institutional enclaves often seen in free trade zones export processing zones or tech hubs where policies and regulations differ from those governing the surrounding society off shore conclaves create environments where both host and sending nations can address specific labour needs without conflicting with broader immigration policies creating a targeted solution that aligns with the host s strategic interests specific industries particularly those with strict operational protocols and high levels of security align well with the off shore conclave model target sectors host economies opportunity areas manufacturing advanced economies like germany japan and the us cost effective workforce deployment retention of domestic production capabilities technology it driven nations like ireland singapore and south korea localised project execution compliance with data security needs construction gulf nations and infrastructure focused economies execution of high value infrastructure projects with targeted indian expertise logistics and shipping port focused nations like the uae and singapore optimisation of port operations and logistics infrastructure though off shore conclaves are relatively new in workforce mobility few precedents illustrate its potential the united arab emirates has numerous free trade zones ftzs where foreign workers are employed under specific conditions and do not integrate fully into the local population fairly non identical to each other this setup demonstrates the operational flexibility that off shore conclaves could offer with dedicated infrastructure housing and support services for foreign workers 96 ireland has a well developed it hub where foreign workers collaborate on project based assignments although these professionals integrate more broadly than envisioned in the off shore conclave model clustering it skills and resources demonstrates how conclaves can streamline productivity while preserving localised expertise south korea established smart factory zones for skilled foreign labour in its industrial sectors demonstrating how conclaves focused on high demand skill sets can serve national goals without disrupting social harmony 97 the off shore conclave model offers unique benefits for both host countries and indian workers source https www acm org binaries content assets public policy usacm intellectual property reports and white papers

location specialised communities efficiency gains through clustering of skilled workers reduced training and adaptation costs for employers support and infrastructure streamlined language skills training healthcare and housing culturally familiar environments for indian workers economic benefits for supplier countries increased remittances opportunities for workforce development showcasing indian expertise globally cost efficiency for employers reduced labour turnover and recruitment costs operational efficiencies in housing and transportation implementing off shore conclaves requires close coordination between indian authorities and host governments as well as specific policy adaptations to ensure the sustainability and acceptance of these conclaves the success of off shore conclaves hinges on clear bilateral agreements outlining worker rights legal protections and operational guidelines these agreements should specify worker residency labour conditions and repatriation rights specialised conclaves will also need streamlined licensing processes to ensure indian workers qualifications are recognised for their roles supplier countries and the host nation must collaborate to establish qualification equivalencies and licensing standards particularly in regulated fields like healthcare conclave infrastructure must include support services such as healthcare housing language programmes and legal assistance to promote a stable and productive working environment india could play an active role in providing these services supported by a liaison office within the host country to address worker needs host nations can incentivise this participation by allowing flexible financial arrangements including remittance facilitation and possible tax exemptions workers in these conclaves would benefit from remittance mechanisms that support their families back home stimulating economic gains for both countries the limited social interaction with the broader host society may affect workers in conclaves increasing the scope for social isolation to mitigate this conclaves could organise cross cultural exchanges and localised social programmes to build connections while respecting the host country s cultural boundaries in some countries conclaves could face public opposition due to concerns about isolationist practices public awareness campaigns emphasising the benefits of conclaves such as addressing critical labour shortages and supporting national growth could help improve perceptions and ease local concerns also over reliance on conclaves may challenge workforce integration and adaptability in the host economy especially for industries requiring evolving skill sets while the off shore conclave model presents a compelling solution for specific workforce needs in socio politically sensitive contexts critical considerations regarding clear policies and targeted sectoral approaches have limited its adoption and scalability 6 2 3 model 3 guest worker programmes the guest worker programmes model offers the most flexible and temporary arrangement where indian workers can work in the host country for a specific period before returning home unlike permanent or semi autonomous conclave based migration guest worker programmes are typically geared toward filling short to medium term labour shortages particularly in seasonal project based or demand driven sectors the model has been successfully implemented worldwide balancing the host country s immediate economic needs with a temporary integration approach that aligns with the host society s preferences guest worker programmes represent a time bound solution that minimises permanent settlement or cultural integration concerns the guest worker model aligns with several economic theories particularly the labour market segmentation theory 98 which explains how labour markets are often divided into primary and secondary segments the primary segment consists of stable well paid jobs requiring high skill levels often filled by native workers or long term immigrants in contrast the secondary segment is characterised by lower wages minimal benefits and seasonal or temporary work which native workers may find less attractive guest worker programmes enable workers to fill these secondary sector jobs helping host economies maintain productivity without a permanent influx of foreign workers pwc making the case for global workforce migration a strategic blueprint to harness india s demographic dividend 38 99 human capital theory is an economic framework that

particularly well suited to address the cyclical and seasonal nature of labour demand in specific sectors by allowing host economies to scale their workforce during peak demand periods without committing to permanent immigration as these programmes ensure flexibility and cost efficiency for workers such arrangements offer consistent short term employment opportunities abroad providing an additional income stream and exposure to advanced techniques and practices these programmes can contribute to economic sustainability for workers by reducing underemployment in rural and semi skilled segments enhancing skill sets through knowledge transfer and enabling remittances that support their families and local economies back home additionally the human capital theory99 suggests that the temporary nature of guest worker programmes allows workers to gain skills and experience abroad that can be reinvested in their home country upon their return this model provides remittance inflows for supplier countries and helps boost domestic human capital when skilled workers bring back newly acquired knowledge and experience guest worker programmes are most effective in sectors that have

hinges on transparent and fair policy frameworks protecting workers rights and host country interests bilateral agreements between supplier and host nations should clarify worker rights wages benefits and health insurance provisions these agreements should ensure fair treatment prevent exploitation and facilitate repatriation processes when contracts conclude countries could utilise their pre departure training for workers to maximise productivity and minimise adjustment challenges for these short term roles this orientation should include skill alignment language training and cultural sensitivity sessions to prepare the workers to meet host country s expectations over a shorter time span ensuring workers have access to adequate health and safety protections is essential especially in sectors like construction and agriculture regulatory oversight in host countries and advocacy by country missions abroad can help uphold safety standards and reduce workplace risks a critical aspect often amiss in limited contracts due to their temporary status guest workers remain vulnerable to exploitation strong governance and reporting mechanisms along with bilateral protections can safeguard indian workers rights ensuring that they receive fair wages and humane working conditions primarily driven by demand employment opportunities for guest workers can vary based on economic conditions and programme instability can leave workers vulnerable to abrupt changes bilateral agreements should include contingency plans which provide support in case of unexpected terminations and repatriation assistance if necessary despite the challenges for each arrangement they present significant opportunities for capitalising upon the indian workforce s economic potential however certain operational practices surrounding these arrangements need to be worked upon by implementing appropriate policy and regulatory frameworks moreover it is mostly a cyclical journey that workers undergo as they go abroad assimilate in the host countries gain valuable skills adapt to their cultural nuances send remittances or eventually return to their country each stage in this cycle has its complexities the next chapter summarises the various stages of workforce mobility from a lifecycle approach understanding this lifecycle highlights the enduring impact of workforce mobility on both the home and the host countries it underpins the need for constant support and policy alignment to sustain this beneficial exchange aspect key benefits addressing labour shortages mitigates short term labour gaps in sectors like agriculture tourism and construction provides cost effective workforce solutions without long term integration challenges skills transfer and capacity building enhances the skill sets and employability of indian workers through international experience supports india s human capital development and competitiveness in domestic job markets economic stability and worker protection it offers a politically viable solution for host countries to fill critical jobs it provides structured contracts legal protections and improved working conditions for workers source orf analysis pwc making the case for global workforce migration a strategic blueprint to harness india s demographic dividend 40 7 1 mapping opportunities global labour markets are experiencing a supply deficit and india has the potential to alleviate this crisis the capacity of the country to fulfil global demand is underpinned by a steady pipeline of highly skilled professionals in areas such as software engineers healthcare specialists advanced manufacturing and infrastructure development experts mature economies such as germany japan and canada seek talent to address their demographic imbalances thereby presenting prime pathways for indian human capital deployment in global markets bilateral labour agreements regional frameworks and multilateral mobility pacts have begun to harmonise regulatory standards and streamline processes however persistent barriers remain therefore there is a need to reconcile cross border qualification equivalences navigate evolving protectionist stances and craft policies that ensure workers rights and well being abroad according to a survey conducted by the global labor market conference 103 most workers consider technological change to be the greatest disruptor of labour markets in the dynamic global landscape where technology is infused in every task workers have to acquire skills that cater to technology heavy jobs thus it is evident that the migration of workers from countries like india must involve skilled labour however skilled labour usually has the bandwidth to access jobs across boundaries given the rate of technological change they are also in greater demand to enhance the rate of workforce migration from countries including india the low to medium skilled workers need to be prepared for international jobs before delving into the policy requirements to facilitate such movement we look at labour market data to identify which sectors actually have the greatest demand 07 lifecycle analysis of workforce movement 103 s cote navigating tomorrow mastering skills in a dynamic global labor market global labor market conference november 2024 104 u s bureau of labor statistics table 1 job openings levels and rates by industry and region seasonally adjusted february 04 2025 job vacancy rate shows the proportion of new opening or vacancies as a proportion of all possible jobs in a sector higher job vacancy rate implies greater demand or shorter supply in the sector the greatest job vacancy rate was recorded in administrative and support service activities construction information and communication professional scientific and technical activities and accommodation and food service activities followed in order thus it is evident that demand for workers is linear across skill levels as there is a greater demand for highly skilled workforce according to a report 104 the greatest number of vacancies in the us are in the professional and business services sectors i e the highly educated workers at the top percentiles of skill level private education and health services follows with other sectors like hospitality trade and transportation portraying similar demand similarly in the uk as of november 2024 human health and social activities have the most vacancies it is followed by hospitality retail and trade thus broader trends across developing countries showcase the demand for skilled workers moreover the demand for professionals in finance healthcare and hospitality is exponential the next section delves into how governments can design policies to catalyse a country s workforce into a global one through directed focus on key sectors pwc making the case for global workforce migration a strategic blueprint to harness india s demographic dividend 41 to maximise the dividends of these transnational labour flows countries must refine their approach by analysing market requirements through data analytics bolstering technical and soft skills training and reinforcing institutional capacities that support ethical recruitment equitable wage standards and conducive work environments it is also essential to support the human dimension by supporting workers and their families through pre departure orientation mentorship schemes and post assignment reintegration programmes that acknowledge personal growth trajectories and cultural transitions 7 2 demand generation due to a global scarcity in talent as well as a dynamic shift in skill requirements governments can pursue a multidimensional approach in order to generate global demand for domestic talent governments can have high preference towards regional as well as bilateral labour schemes which promote global labour mobility along with establishing associations with developed which have a demographic and skills shortfall which can be overcome with a secure preferred migration corridor such arrangements can facilitate work permit formalities ease documentation as well as facilitate smoother identification overseas the role of technology more specifically that of ai will have to be addressed in a labour welfare policy some early steps can be in terms of opening specialised training institutes and skill development centres in high priority industries low skilled as well as medium skilled labour can be upskilled with short duration certificates digital literacy and sectoral course training in line with global sectoral demands these can greatly boost employability abroad one of the largest challenges which workers face is the absence of standard training and qualifications india aims to improve this with the new education policy however government co operation with global bodies which accredit qualifications as well as investments in culture based professional development and language training will be necessary to achieve standardisation by focusing on sectors with high vacancy rates like administrative support construction ict healthcare and hospitality indian policymakers can channel talent into disciplines most sought after internationally this means working closely with industry stakeholders both at home and abroad to forecast demand identify skill gaps and fine tune curriculum thus creating steady pipelines of well trained professionals ready to meet global market needs the government can also launch global awareness campaigns by participating in international job fairs collaborating with overseas chambers of commerce and leveraging diplomatic missions to showcase the quality adaptability and cultural fluency of indian workers emphasising india s track record in ict healthcare and professional services can position its workforce as a premium choice thus raising overall global demand by following a mix of these strategies governments in supplier countries can systematically shape their workforce into a globally recognized talent pool fostering both individual economic opportunities and enhanced national competitiveness in an increasingly interconnected labour market pwc making the case for global workforce migration a strategic blueprint to harness india s demographic dividend 42 7 3 india model learnings to emulate for other supplier countries 7 3 1 skill upgradation bridging the gap to meet global standards india has emerged as a leading international supplier of skilled workers leveraging its demographic dividend with systematic skill formation and mobility programmes initiatives such as national skill development mission nsdm and skill india and international skilling collaborations have enhanced training quality strengthened alignment with labour markets and facilitated migration pathways india s global capability centres gccs and strategic partnerships with destination countries indicate its increasingly significant role in the international economy nevertheless there are limitations related to unequal geographic coverage industry specific training gaps and barriers to returnee professional integration by addressing such limitations and enhancing its skilling and migration systems india can establish itself as an important player in exportable workforce and reap significant economic benefits india has taken significant steps to address inconsistent training quality and governance bottlenecks in its skill development ecosystem the national skill development mission nsdm launched in 2015 provides a cohesive framework to strengthen institutional mechanisms and enhance training reach and quality while the skill strengthening for industrial value enhancement strive initiative introduced in 2017 with world bank focuses on improving the efficiency and market relevance of vocational training through modernised infrastructure and industry partnerships the skill acquisition and knowledge awareness for livelihood promotion sankalp programme also initiated in 2016 aims to resolve governance challenges by building robust district level training structures and ensuring inclusivity in skill development additionally the national skill development corporation nsdc established in 2009 has streamlined private sector participation in skilling improving quality assurance and fostering innovation these initiatives collectively try to address the systemic challenges demonstrating india s commitment to building a globally competitive workforce significant progress has been made over the last decade ensuring that indian workers seamlessly integrate into international labour markets equipping them with globally competitive skills this means improving technical competencies and addressing cultural linguistic and adaptability challenges for example india s global capability centres gccs have transformed from traditional back office operations into hubs of strategic innovation significantly impacting the global professional services sector employing nearly 1 9 million professionals these centres over 1 700 across india as of 2024 generate usd 64 6 billion in revenue with projections to reach usd 105 billion by 2030 105 they now encompass high value functions such as research and development advanced analytics and finance showcasing india s skilled workforce and mature offshoring ecosystem this evolution highlights india s role as a leading destination for professional services driven by its vast talent pool and growing expertise in delivering global business solutions the training ecosystem in india while expanding over the years often faces infrastructure gaps quality concerns and limited alignment to industrial needs particularly in the wider context of global mobility 106 many of the remaining binding constraints will need to be overcome before india truly becomes a global hub for skilled labour india s skilling landscape still has uneven geographic coverage and dated curricula which often has limited relevance given the demands of industry 4 0 addressing this requires a targeted approach including a comprehensive need mapping exercise to identify skillsets in demand across target countries for workforce export such as healthcare in japan construction in the gulf cooperation council gcc nations information technology in europe and north america and advanced manufacturing in germany rural areas remain underserved exacerbating the urban rural divide in skilling outcomes furthermore the lack of well trained trainers undermines the effectiveness of existing programmes recognition of informal skills a key aspect for large segments of india s workforce remains minimal leaving many workers underqualified to participate in international labour markets despite having substantial experience 107 india s demographic challenge compounds these structural challenges as the working age population grows skilling infrastructure must expand proportionately to meet rising demand 105 national association of software and service companies nasscom india gcc landscape report a 5 year

wheebox india skills report 2024 accessed february 27 2025 pwc making the case for global workforce migration a strategic blueprint to harness india s demographic dividend 43 to bridge this gap introducing nationally recognised certifications for informal skills and establishing partnerships with global accrediting bodies could ensure that india s workforce meets international standards for example collaborations with organisations such as the international labour organization ilo or industry specific certifying authorities could enhance the global employability of indian workers nevertheless many initiatives across india tend to focus on entry level skills neglecting opportunities for advanced or specialised training required by global markets 108 on the demand side a recent

february 27 2025 112 rama v baru privatisation and corporatisation in unhealthy trends a symposium on the state of our public health system may 2000 for india this approach underlines the importance of encouraging initial migration and the eventual return of skilled workers with the potential to enrich domestic workers india s own history also offers lessons in the 1980s a wave of reverse migration of medical professionals from the middle east and western countries promoted the rapid growth of private healthcare across different parts of the country equipped with global expertise and financial capital these professionals established hospitals and diagnostic centres that reformed healthcare delivery in india 112 this example which is one of the significant contributors for turning india into a health tourism hub shows how the strategic reintegration of skilled professionals can deliver transformative change a lesson that remains relevant because india wants to tailor its competent ecosystem to global standards the ongoing partnerships with for example germany and japan have led to targeted improvements in health and industrial skills while language and cultural orientation programmes are also being implemented 110 these tailor made efforts will make it easier for workers not only to meet the technical standards of the destination economies but also to integrate them into their new environment in addition ai driven platforms such as skill india digital hub have started addressing infrastructure and access challenges offering online courses in emerging technologies such as robotics data analytics and green energy these platforms bring world class training to rural and semi urban areas 111 another example is the reverse migration among it professionals and renewable energy experts returning it professionals equipped with global expertise in ai blockchain and cybersecurity could establish cutting edge technology start ups or enhance the digital infrastructure of existing enterprises and enable india to become a formidable force in the global tech economy similarly renewable energy experts could spearhead innovative projects in solar and wind energy contributing to india s ambitious green energy transition and sustainability goals pwc making the case for global workforce migration a strategic blueprint to harness india s demographic dividend 44 7 3 2 recruitment and compliance navigating complex pathways the process of navigating global standards and examining the destination countries labour laws can often be intimidating for migrants successful recruitment not only improves a country s reputation as a source of skilled labour and also offers economic and social benefits to employees as well as their families back home transparency fairness and compliance with international labour laws are central to this process india has steadily improved its recruitment processes by introducing regulatory mechanisms to eliminate malpractice and exploitation the emigrate platform in india launched in 2015 is an example of an important component of such reforms by keeping a database of accredited recruitment agencies and keeping track of placements of employees the platform minimises fraud and ensures that employees are focused on legitimate opportunities 113 specialised modules within the platform teach employees about their rights and the legal requirements of destination countries pre departure orientation programmes developed in collaboration with the national skill development corporation nsdc serve as an essential part of the recruitment pipeline these programmes provide workers with practical knowledge of the laws workplace expectations and cultural nuances of host countries for example indian caregivers who go to japan are given language training under the specified skilled worker programme and are informed about japanese elderly care practices 114 such initiatives not only increase the willingness of workers but also reduce the risk of conflicts due to cultural misunderstandings overseas workers resource centre owrc and migrant resource centres mrcs run by the ministry of external affairs play an essential role in supporting workers these offer document verification legal assistance and a communication channel for working families 115 maintaining international labour laws is a critical requirement for fair treatment of indian workers abroad bilateral agreements in existence such as the india germany migration and mobility partnership 116 illustrate best practices to better align indian workers rights with the legal framework of host countries these agreements facilitate streamlined quicker visa procedures and allow mutual recognition of skills thus facilitating employment for example german employers who hire indian it professionals benefit from accelerated validation processes while indian workers gain access to secure contracts and social protection another key component of compliance is the existence of a redressal system for complaints indian missions abroad in cooperation with local authorities have set up mechanisms to enable workers to report exploitation or unsafe conditions regular audits of recruitment agencies are conducted to ensure accountability and violations often lead to sanctions or withdrawal of licenses 117 such measures are expected to strengthen confidence between workers employers and governments and strengthen india s position as a reliable source of labour india can draw lessons from the experience of the philippine overseas employment administration poea the poea provides a robust regulatory framework guaranteeing ethical recruitment practices and protects employees through strict compliance checks for example filipino carers benefit from pre departure briefings containing comprehensive information on employment contracts wage structures and legal rights 118 the philippines model not only emphasised transparency but also improved its global reputation leading to preferential treatment in sectors such as care and construction 113 ashwin kumar uncovering the

transition process is crucial to ensure success in their new roles and environments by addressing both tangible and intangible aspects of migration india can improve the adaptability satisfaction and productivity of workers the logistics of international relocations includes complex coordination workers must secure their work visas undergo health screenings and arrange transport often while navigating unknown bureaucratic processes india s emigrate platform has simplified this journey by providing a centralised hub for documentation and visa applications 119 pre departure health check ups prescribed for workers on their way to countries with strict public health regulations ensure compliance with host country rules and protect the well being of workers financial planning is another crucial element of the migration process many workers leave dependent persons dependent on transfers for their livelihoods workshops on financial literacy carried out in cooperation with banks and ngos help employees to understand transfer systems manage foreign exchange and avoid predatory financial practices 120 these efforts ensure that employees can support their families and build financial security abroad onboarding goes beyond mere logistics and integrates themes such as cultural assimilation and workplace readiness cultural orientation programmes prepare workers for social standards work etiquette and language needs of host countries thus smoothening the integration process these sessions not only improve the professional communication within their employment but also help them navigate daily life germany s extensive integration courses constitute a global benchmark these programmes combine language education cultural education and preparation at the workplace so that workers are well equipped to contribute to their host communities 121 for indian workers in sectors such as it and healthcare these courses have proved transformative improving both productivity and labour satisfaction as india enhances its cooperation with germany including such practices in its on boarding framework could bring significant benefits in addition to germany many other destination countries have implemented effective programmes aimed specifically at supporting migrant workers singapore s migrant workers centre mwc runs initiatives that include skills training workplace rights education and cultural orientation to ensure smooth integration into local workplaces in canada the federal skilled worker programme fswp focuses on attracting skilled professionals

employee employer mapping seem 123 in order to further leverage the expertise of repatriates india has developed sector specific reintegration frameworks in the it sector returning professionals are encouraged to teach at institutions where they can guide the next generation of engineers and technologists 124 125 these efforts facilitate translation of globally acquired experiences into domestic capacity building historically one of the most impactful ways in which repatriates contribute is through entrepreneurship the wave of returning doctors in the 1980s discussed earlier played a crucial role in shaping indian private healthcare which emerged as the majority care provider in the past decades today programmes like startup india offer funding mentoring and other benefits to entrepreneurs to promote innovation across sectors 126 india could also draw inspiration from israel and china where returning scientists and entrepreneurs have driven progress in technology and production 127 through targeted incentives these countries have successfully reintegrated repatriated professionals who have created start ups developed advanced technologies and strengthened the national innovation ecosystem by emulating this model india can also develop a robust innovation hub and attract global investors and participants at the same time reintegration is not without challenges workers often find it difficult to adapt to the domestic labour market and the social environment 128 financial literacy programmes help repatriates to manage savings and investments while psychosocial support services address the emotional toll of adjustment while there are strong non financial incentives to relocate to india 129 the country could also consider offering enhanced tax holidays or matching subsidies to repatriates wishing to set up companies to maximise their contributions with its demographic dividend projected to peak in the coming decades india stands at a pivotal juncture strategic investments in education skill development and healthcare are imperative to harness this potential enabling the workforce to meet evolving economic demands neglecting these areas could result in missed opportunities for economic growth and development pwc making the case for global workforce migration a strategic blueprint to harness india s demographic dividend 47 the evolving dynamics of the global labour market has presented countries with younger population like india with the unprecedented opportunity to leverage its demographic dividend and consolidate its position as a crucial contributor to the international workforce a well structured and adaptive strategy is essential to ensure that workforce mobility is not only economically advantageous but also sustainable in the long term such a strategy must align with global employment trends protect the interests of workers and optimise the reciprocal benefits for both supplier and host economies the following recommendations grounded in technical and scenario analyses of the report provide a framework for advancing workforce mobility skill enhancement and reintegration mechanisms to maximise developmental outcomes for india and the world multi tiered approach to skilling to optimise the economic benefits of migration countries must adopt a comprehensive policy framework which integrates economic social and institutional dimensions a tiered migration strategy should be developed to address the distinct needs of high skilled mid skilled and low skilled workers which also focusses on harmonising skilling ecosystem as per international standards such differentiation will facilitate targeted policies that promote skill mobility while ensuring migrant welfare overseas leveraging and strengthening existing bilateral and multilateral agreements will be crucial to standardising credentials streamlining visa pathways recognition of skills and removing institutional bottlenecks that impede labour market access in destination countries 08 recommendations furthermore countries must transition from a transactional view of migration to a cyclical knowledge exchange process establishing a global talent network will facilitate sustained engagement with the diaspora from the country fostering mentorship linkages employment updates investment collaborations upskilling opportunities and cross border innovation partnerships these mechanisms will not only enhance a country s global labour footprint but also create reverse knowledge flows that contribute to domestic economic progress demand based skilling to enhance supply to fully harness the demographic advantage countries must implement a data driven and industry aligned skilling ecosystem which dynamically responds to global workforce demands a forward looking labour market intelligence system converged with existing migrant databases maintained by nodal ministries of the country should be institutionalised to assess employment trends and anticipate skill shortages in key geographies this will enable the development of targeted skilling programmes that prepare workers for high demand sectors such as healthcare in japan ai in europe and sustainable energy in australia herein engagements with the destination country employers may be actively undertaken by countries like india to advocate for a country s supply strength skill anticipation labour market demand aggregation and ecosystem enablement for labour mobility along with placement opportunities countries like india should also expand structured international mobility programmes that facilitate career development through global exposure while preserving pathways for return migration these initiatives should be accompanied by comprehensive pre departure training modules covering language proficiency cultural orientation and workplace adaptation strategies pwc making the case for global workforce migration a strategic blueprint to harness india s demographic dividend 48 by equipping workers with these competencies countries can enhance their integration prospects and long term professional mobility in foreign labour markets furthermore emphasis may be given to introduce online foreign language courses and cultural immersion programmes under the skilling programmes of the government technical and vocational education and training tvet institutions and other institutions preparing candidates for migration adopting and creating innovative models of mobility a diversified and resilient workforce mobility strategy necessitates the adoption of innovative models beyond conventional migration pathways one such model is the off shore conclave framework wherein destination economies establish dedicated workforce enclaves designed to host foreign workers within sector specific clusters these zones can be structured with tailored legal protections regulatory oversight and social infrastructure to enhance worker productivity while addressing host country concerns regarding large scale immigration additionally expanding structured young professionals and guest worker programmes which offer well defined entry and exit pathways can create a sustainable model for temporary labour mobility such programmes should incorporate provisions for skills accreditation performance based contract extensions and structured reintegration mechanisms for returning workers a robust governance must be established to ensure ethical recruitment practices minimise worker exploitation and maintain transparent oversight of workforce mobility patterns greater focus on reintegration through technology for international workforce mobility to yield enduring benefits reintegration strategies must be designed to optimise the knowledge and expertise of returning professionals establishing a national returnee workforce initiative and upskilling agenda will facilitate a seamless transition for repatriated workers by offering targeted incentives such as tax reliefs entrepreneurship grants and preferential hiring programmes in strategic industries reintegration hubs should be developed to provide tailored financial planning services psychological counselling and career development resources to ensure holistic support for returning workers further countries like india should invest in an ai enabled workforce transition platform which systematically maps the competencies of returnees to emerging domestic employment opportunities this initiative should be complemented by strengthened partnerships with international accreditation bodies to standardise skill certifications ensuring the continued employability of indian workers in global markets a coordinated strategy encompassing both outbound migration facilitation and returnee reintegration will position such countries as a leader in international workforce mobility while fostering inclusive economic growth extending social security framework to include skill migration recommendations for india 130 ministry of labour employment government of india social security for gig and platform workers press release november 25 2024 rapid technological changes rise of remote work and increased automation has led to a transformational shift in labour employment away from traditional long term location based jobs to task based work that can be performed remotely the rise of freelance work and the gig economy has enabled outsourcing of tasks to a flexible globally distributed workforce without the need of any physical movement of labour while technological advancements will further enhance demand for skilled labour the de linking of skills and services from labour currently underway is expected to lead to increased global migration of skills without cross border physical movement of labour this presents significant opportunities for global migration of indian labour and skills but also poses challenges particularly with regards to employment stability and access to social security in absence of well crafted labour regulations pertaining to the same based on the above recommendations table 12 depicts a set of mobility value chain guidelines which may be beneficial for the various stakeholders of workforce mobility hence it is essential to design a supportive regulatory framework to facilitate the current dynamics a key component of this will be expanding the social safety net currently available for domestic workforce to include freelancing and platforms workers offering their services across geographies to a global clientele while gig and platform workers have been defined in the code on social security 2020 130 and the government has set up a committee to suggest a social security

josipamajic 2024 09 09 rise of family offices trillion dollar shadows in global finance 2 pwc indian family offices the new investors for india s startup ecosystem the symbiotic relationship between family offices and startups the start up ecosystem has given rise to multiple opportunities for family offices while earlier family offices feared this asset class due to the risks related to these investments many are now increasing their allocation towards this asset class startups also prefer family offices as they have patient capital and are less demanding when it comes to a seat at the board management information systems mis and operational oversight as compared to venture capitalists vcs the long term capital provided by family offices supports sustainable growth and helps startups avoid the pressures of rapid exits often demanded by other investors family offices also offer enhanced credibility and access to a global network of influential contacts single family offices in india have been actively investing in the startup ecosystem they have specialist teams who understand the dynamics of an investment process and the associated risks in startups multi family offices facilitate such investment opportunities for their member family offices however multi family offices are also setting up their own fund structures alternative investment fund aifs with select families which participate as lp and these funds then professionally invest in startups this new model reduces the risks for individual family offices as they have professional intermediaries who evaluate the quality of investment parameters of evaluation include the founder s credentials the business model which is being deployed and the organisational strategy and control the investment process why family offices invest in startups 1 access to new age ideas and technology startups are a high risk high reward asset class and newer family offices are allocating portions of their portfolios for startup investments as it allows them to diversify their portfolios and gain exposure to disruptive and innovative technologies and high growth ventures thus allowing them to access cutting edge technologies and complement their traditional investment assets it also provides opportunities for capital appreciation higher return on investment roi than traditional investments and an opportunity to network with the brightest and the most innovative minds in the industry 2 impact investing some family offices are also investing in startups which creates social impact or addresses environmental related concerns it also allows them to brand themselves through association as conscious modern businesses 3 diversification investing into the startup ecosystem allows the new generation of family businesses to diversify into newer businesses and sectors without disturbing their core family business this addresses an important element of continuity of family togetherness by allowing the next gen to experiment without inhibitions for example some of the startups have been seeded by the new gen family members through initial funding from their own family office and then later raised funds from outside vcs and pes 3 pwc indian family offices the new investors for india s startup ecosystem 4 pwc indian family offices the new investors for india s startup ecosystem ways in which family offices can invest in startups 1 direct investments these can be done via equity investments in startups becoming shareholders and potentially gaining board seats direct investments can be made during the seed funding stage which comprises investing the initial capital for startups to kickstart their business or via the later stage funding rounds of series a b c where startups have a more established business model along with a fair amount of the desired market validation investing via convertible notes debt instruments which convert into equity at a later stage often during a future funding round is another approach this route offers some downside protection while retaining the equity upside 2 vc funds putting money in vc funds which focus on startup investments has often proven to be a safe approach this provides exposure to a diversified portfolio of startups and mitigates the risk arising from investing in a single startup vcs also often provide co investment opportunities to their lps enabling family offices to invest along with them in specific startups 3 angel networks joining angel investor networks gives family offices the opportunity to co invest with other experienced investors helping them leverage the advantages from a quality deal flow and shared due diligence 4 incubators and accelerators investing in or partnering with incubators and accelerators enables family offices to gain early access to promising startups and the opportunity to mentor them through their growth stages thus providing the former with an edge in their investment practices 5 corporate vc this includes setting up a corporate venture arm in the scenario where the family office has a formidable business turnover this permits strategic investments in those startups which align with the family office s business operations and strategic goals 5 pwc indian family offices the new investors for india s startup ecosystem key considerations for investing into startups the following factors must be taken into consideration before investing in startups the founding team the educational and family background capabilities motivation and vision of the founders are critical factors the founding team must have a business plan roadmap and milestones carved out for their business due diligence conducting a comprehensive due diligence assessing the size of the total addressable market tam figuring out the financial kpis along with ensuring legal and regulatory compliance should be considered before investing it is important to keep negative branding and risks of litigation at bay sector focus a targeted approach towards key sectors with strategic intent is important for enhancing the probability of success for the family office while the original sector in which they operate is a good starting point for considering startups in the same space many family offices are also exploring new age sectors such as renewable energy fintech healthtech and other emerging sectors to invest in risk management it is recommended to diversify investments into different ventures strategic investment plan spread across the different stages and lifecycles of a startup helps mitigate the risks of a sunk cost exit strategies family offices should have a clearly defined exit plan along with timelines terms of separation should be discussed and agreed upon before making the investment these terms may include initial public offerings mergers and acquisitions buybacks secondary sale of equity and other terms it is common practise to invest at a more advanced stage in startups on their path towards ipo to help them get better returns for the investor earlier family offices were comfortable with investing into startups as a follow up investment to qualified vcs usually top tier vcs as they relied on the diligence and judgement of such investors however this investment by family offices did not augur well for them always as the vcs investment thesis allowed them to lose money on select investments usually offset by bumper returns in other investments in the larger pool secondly post investment vcs are used to having their own peculiar ways of managing their investments including using board seats effectively they also have competent teams to analyse the mis of such investments on the other hand family offices are usually understaffed thereby making this form of investments comparatively risky therefore family offices which believe in investing in startups regularly need to develop inhouse capabilities with due augmentation from external professionals to undertake their own due diligence with respect to financial commercial legal or human resources aspects in order to take informed decisions pertaining to the business s long term viability although this process may prove to be expensive it will help them to undertake proper evaluation and thus make gainful investments 2 https economictimes indiatimes com industry banking
