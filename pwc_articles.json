Only 15% of plastic waste gets collected for \nrecycling at a global scale and nearly half of it still ends up being discarded irresponsibly.1 This indicates that \nonly 9% of waste actually gets recycled.2 Over the last two decades, the world has doubled its production of \nplastic with most of it ending up in landfills or being incinerated. A recent Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) report reveals that a staggering 91% of waste is not recycled.3 Another \nreport by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) indicates that in 2016, an estimated 11 million \nmetric tonnes of plastic trash found its way into the ocean.4\nIndia plays a significant role in the plastic waste crisis. The country is one of the twelve countries which are \naccountable for 60% of the worlds mismanaged plastic.5 With a population exceeding 1.4 billion people, India \nproduces 26,000 tonnes of plastic waste daily which is equivalent to about 26,000 small cars.6 \nIn a bid to combat this, on 5 June 2018, the Prime Minister announced that India would phase out single-use \nplastics by 2022. Following this, on 12 August 2021, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change \n(MOEFCC) enforced a ban on certain single-use plastic items from 1 July 2022. Since 2016, the Plastic Waste \nManagement Rules have made it mandatory for users of plastics to collect and recycle their waste. These \nextended producer responsibility (EPR) rules, initially voluntary, are now enforced through an online\nEPR trading platform.7,8 \nThe retail and consumer goods industry is facing growing pressure to adopt sustainable practices driven by \nregulations, investors and consumers. The twenty-first century’s consumers focus on human rights, tackling \nclimate change and supporting businesses which embrace circular economy practices. In India, a majority of \nconsumers are now willing to invest more in products with sustainable and minimal packaging for their \npurchases. In recent times, there have been major changes in India’s regulatory landscape to improve plastic \nwaste management and effectively implement EPR. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the Ministry of \nEnvironment, Forest and Climate Change (MOEFCC), and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India \n(FSSAI) have come up with new laws and policy regulations which indicate a promising movement towards \ntackling the country’s waste management challenges. Investors, too, want to know how a company’s \nsustainability plans are aligned with its business model and, ultimately, its prospects for creating long-term value.\n1. https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2022/02/plastic-pollution-is-growing-relentlessly-as-waste-management-and-\nrecycling-fall-short.html\n2.

A structured ESG governance framework is crucial for executing a \nsustainable packaging strategy in a company. Brand perception of sustainability is shaped by both external \ncommunication and internal performance. Aligning green marketing outreach with sustainability reporting \nstandards is crucial for companies to have effective outbound communication mechanisms. Let us explore these \nelements in detail. \nFigure 2: A holistic approach to sustainable packaging practices\nSource: PwC analysis \nPwC | Sustainable packaging in the FMCG and retail sector\n6\nApril 2025 | \n\n03\nTo boost profitability and meet both mandatory and voluntary targets, companies must optimise packaging and \nmake it more economical and sustainable. This involves focusing on four key action fields – rethink, reduce, \nreuse and recycle.\nRethink: This action requires a fundamental rethinking of product and portfolio design and business processes \nto reduce the use of plastic across its products and logistics. Companies might also need to venture into other \nsegments of the value chain, such as the recycling market, and determine outsourcing options to secure long-\nterm material access.\nReduce: Reducing resource consumption is a strategic lever for companies which are aiming to save costs while \nmeeting their sustainability goals. The primary focus is on reducing packaging material itself, as seen through \nlightweighting or designing with less material. Reducing energy requirements, transportation needs and \npackaging-related waste are key focus areas for reducing plastic waste. \nReuse: Packaging designed for multiple uses, such as refillable containers or returnable crates can significantly \ncut down the use of single-use waste. Reuse strategies also pave the way for closed-loop systems that can \nstrengthen consumer relationships.\nRecycle: Though recycling is important, finding the right method of recycling is essential to yield the best results. \nOne of the ways in which recycling can be effectively implemented is by using materials which are easily \nrecyclable and support the existing recycling infrastructure. \nFigure 3: Holistic and sustainable packaging optimisation action fields\nOptimising packaging for \nprofitability and sustainability \nthrough the 4Rs9\n9. https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/de/en/industries/consumer-markets/mastering-food-and-beverage-packaging.html\nSource: https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/de/en/industries/consumer-markets/mastering-food-and-beverage-packaging.html\nPwC | Sustainable packaging in the FMCG and retail sector\n7\nApril 2025 | \n\nA sustainable packaging feasibility assessment encompasses a comprehensive approach which integrates \nvarious aspects of the business to create packaging solutions that are not only environmentally friendly but also \neconomically viable, legally compliant and marketable. Understanding these interconnected aspects of \nsustainable packaging strategy is essential for businesses which are aiming to implement these\nstrategies effectively.\nTechnical aspect\nThe technical aspect focuses on the advancements in materials and technologies used to develop sustainable \npackaging. This includes exploring new biodegradable materials, improving recyclability and innovating \npackaging designs which can reduce waste and enhance product durability. \nEnvironmental aspect\nThe environmental aspect examines the environmental footprint of packaging, specifically on carbon \nemissions, waste minimisation and natural resources. This aspect aims at addressing global environmental \nchallenges.\nFinancial aspect\nThe financial aspect analyses the cost-effectiveness and economic benefits of sustainable packaging. It \nconsiders the initial investment in sustainable materials and technologies, potential long-term savings through \nresource efficiency and local sourcing of materials. \nRegulatory aspect\nThe regulatory aspect involves navigating the complex landscape of laws and regulations governing packaging \nstandards. Compliance with environmental regulations, such as extended producer responsibility, restrictions \non hazardous substances and mandates for recycling is essential for avoiding legal penalties. \nMarketing aspect\nThe marketing aspect highlights the role of sustainable packaging in enhancing consumer appeal and \nstrengthening brand identity. Eco-friendly packaging can give a brand a competitive edge in the market, attract \nenvironmentally conscious consumers and build brand loyalty. \n04 Determining the\nfeasibility of sustainable \npackaging strategies\nPwC | Sustainable packaging in the FMCG and retail sector\n8\nApril 2025 | \n\nFigure 4: Interconnected aspects of sustainable packaging\nAbbreviation\nInterconnections between aspects\nRationale\nSP: Sustainable \npackaging\nTA: Technical aspect\nEA: Environmental \naspect\nFA: Financial aspect\nRA: Regulatory \naspect\nMA: Marketing \naspect\nCost efficiency <-> Market demands\nSuggests that cost efficiency is \ninfluenced by market demands and \nvice versa.\nEco-friendly materials <-> \nCompliance\nImplies that materials chosen for \nsustainability reasons related to \nsustainability might need to comply \nwith regulations.\nRegulatory policies <-> branding\nSuggests that sustainability policies \nmight impact branding strategies for \nsustainable packaging.\nSustainability marketing <-> \nConsumer trends\nIndicates that marketing strategies for \nsustainable packaging are influenced \nby consumer trends.\nTechnical innovations <-> Eco-\nfriendly materials\nIndicates that technical innovations \nmay involve the use of eco-friendly \nmaterials and vice versa.\nSource: PwC analysis \nPwC | Sustainable packaging in the FMCG and retail sector\n9\nApril 2025 | \n\nImplementing any sustainability initiative requires a robust governance framework to ensure effective decision-\nmaking, accountability and continuous improvement. This framework ensures that decisions are made \neffectively, responsibilities are clear and progress is consistently monitored. A comprehensive ESG governance \nmodel seamlessly integrates sustainability into the business operations while fostering innovation, adherence to \nregulations and operational excellence. It is important to verify if the current organisational structure adequately \nsupports the packaging strategy to guarantee its successful implementation across all levels of the organisation.\nFigure 5 depicts how sustainable packaging practices can be structured within an organisation. The figure \nshowcases how business operations, sustainability management functions and board level oversight work \ntogether harmoniously. Business operations handle the aspects of sustainable packaging such as planning, \nexecution and monitoring to ensure that the daily activities align with sustainability objectives. Sustainability \nmanagement functions focus on evaluation, validation of practices and managing risks associated with \nsustainability efforts. The board sets directions and policies that guide sustainability initiatives across the \norganisation. Communication and feedback mechanisms, among these entities facilitate ongoing assessment \nand enhancement of sustainability measures.\nFigure 5: An illustrative governance framework for sustainable packaging practices\nESG governance in packaging\n05\nSource: PwC analysis \nPwC | Sustainable packaging in the FMCG and retail sector\n10\nApril 2025 | \n\n06 Centralising packaging data for \neffective ESG reporting\nOnce the metrics and KPIs are identified, regular monitoring and evaluation of organisational control over this \ninformation becomes indispensable. Becoming an ESG-ready organisation depends on centralising data \ncollection. The quality and granularity of data is important as it helps derive meaningful insights which can help \nthe leadership in making informed decisions. Managing diverse metrics, such as type and quantity of materials \nused, recycled content in materials, energy consumption, recyclability rate and other metrics collected from \nmultiple data owners often requires a streamlined data collection methodology across the organisation. The most \neffective approach involves taking a detailed journey through each metric’s lifecycle, from its source data. \nEstablishing crucial rules for information governance involves implementing an impactful tiered approach, and \ncategorising data based on relevance and impact. Organisational clarity is ensured by clearly defining these \ncategories and aligning them with specific requirements. This streamlines the incorporation of existing metrics \nand the integration of new metrics into the ESG reporting framework as well as ensuring continuous \nimprovement of the overall ESG performance and reporting processes.\nFigure 6: An illustrative packaging related data collection and monitoring dashboard \nSource: PwC analysis \nPwC | Sustainable packaging in the FMCG and retail sector\n11\nApril 2025 | \n\n07 Collaborative partnerships for a \ncircular packaging value chain \nIt is important to form partnerships at every level of the value chain to collectively close the circular loop of raw \nmaterials and packaging waste by:\n•\ncollaborating with suppliers to ensure that they provide details on the recyclability and recycled materials in \nthe packaging they supply\n•\nbuilding partnerships with raw material manufacturers to develop innovative solutions\n•\nworking together with the state governments, waste collectors, sorters, and processors to collaboratively \nestablish an end-of-life system that promotes recyclability. \nAchieving circular packaging necessitates collaboration across the value chain. Once a product reaches the end \nof its lifecycle and becomes waste, various recycling methods such as waste sorting, mechanical recycling and \nchemical recycling can be implemented to ensure its recyclability, thereby preventing the waste from reaching \nlandfills or being incinerated. Numerous stakeholders such as municipalities, waste management firms, physical \nand chemical recyclers, and intermediaries play a crucial role in this value chain and by partnering with recyclers \nand waste management entities, organisations can create an infrastructure that supports complete recyclability \nof these waste materials. \nFigure 7 illustrates the plastic value chain, highlighting the key stakeholders, stages of production and\nrecycling processes.\nFigure 7: An overview of key stakeholders and processes in the plastic value chain\nSource: PwC analysis \nPwC | Sustainable packaging in the FMCG and retail sector\n12\nApril 2025 | \n\n08 Linking sustainability efforts \nwith brand perception\nAn organisation’s sustainability initiatives and branding activities are closely intertwined as many consumers \nassess the company on the basis of their internal ESG performance. How a brand’s sustainability efforts are \nperceived is shaped by how it communicates its presence through media and its sustainability initiatives. \nConveying the brand’s voice and message along with eco-labelling the products plays an important role in \nshaping the consumers views about the brand. However, perception alone is not enough. The internal operations \nof a company drive the authenticity and impact of its sustainability efforts. This includes practices like sourcing \neco-friendly materials, using energy efficient packaging methods and designing packaging that reduces material \nusage and waste production. Training the employees is also important to ensure that sustainable practices \nbecome a part of the company’s culture.\nFigure 8: The role of sustainability in shaping brand perception and shaping consumer trust\nSource: PwC analysis \nPwC | Sustainable packaging in the FMCG and retail sector\n13\nApril 2025 | \n\n09 Communicating\nsustainability initiatives \nCommunication plays an important role in convincing various stakeholders about the sincerity of a company’s \nsustainability endeavours. While some standards such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI),  Integrated \nReporting (IR) Framework, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), Task Force on Climate-related \nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD), United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) among others are \nnon-mandatory and non-binding, other standards and frameworks such as the Business Responsibility and \nSustainability Reporting (BRSR), European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), Corporate Sustainability \nReporting Directive (CSRD), and the Climate Related Disclosures by Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC) are mandatory. In certain cases, internationally accepted reporting frameworks such as GRI, SASB, \nTCFD, Integrated Reporting are referred to by regulatory authorities for cross referencing. Though these \nframeworks and standards share some similarities, there are instances where they don’t align which can pose \npractical challenges for companies which are aiming to create unified and consistent reports that meets the \nexpectations of both investors and jurisdictional compliance and regulations. Ensuring alignment of standards \nand frameworks is crucial for developing a comprehensive reporting procedure.\nFigure 9: An illustrative framework for effective packaging impact reporting\nThe disclosure of positive impacts from sustainable packaging initiatives involves three key steps – evaluate, \nconclude, report – coupled with six fundamental questions. These steps and questions provide a straightforward, \nlucid and practical approach to enhance the confidence in externally reported packaging endeavours. The \nquestions cover why sustainability packaging information is reported and for whom, setting the stage for \nsubsequent decisions on where to report, what to report, how to report, and how much to report. Addressing \nquestions 1 and 2 guides companies in determining the purpose and audience for packaging efforts. This \nfoundation, in turn, informs decisionmakers and helps them decide where and what to report, how to prepare and \npresent the information and how much information to disclose. While questions 1 and 2 precede the others, the \ndynamic nature of the process acknowledges the interplay between questions and steps, emphasising their \ninterconnectedness when making judgments about information disclosure. The strength of an organisation’s \ninitiatives lies in their relevance and transparency, reinforcing their commitment to authentic and impactful \nsustainability practices.\nSource: PwC analysis \nPwC | Sustainable packaging in the FMCG and retail sector\n14\nApril 2025 | \n\n10 Conclusion\nDriving sustainable packaging initiatives requires supervision by an internal stakeholder along with a \ncomprehensive governance of the process and essential/core capabilities that companies often lack. Though the \nsustainability team is often the first point of contact for this process, procurement, sourcing and innovation \ndepartments can also become the drivers for packaging optimisation. Companies need to address the following \naspects to effectively tackle the problem of sustainable packaging:\n•\ncollaboration between various departments\n•\nintegration of cost and sustainability packaging KPIs\n•\nanalysing the portfolio\n•\nengaging in value chain and ecosystem collaboration\n•\ncapacity building for teams\n•\ncommitting to packaging targets set for the organisation\n•\nstrengthening communication with suppliers\n•\nconducting lifecycle assessments of packaging materials\n•\nadopting eco-friendly packaging messaging and branding\n•\nfostering cross-industry partnerships for joint sustainability initiatives.\nIn order to achieve impactful results in driving sustainable packaging initiatives, organisations must adopt these \ninitiatives as a cross-functional priority. A committed approach to sustainable packaging can build trust with \nconsumers, strengthen supplier relationships and positions these organisations as a leaders of sustainability \ninitiatives in the FMCG and retail sector. \nPwC | Sustainable packaging in the FMCG and retail sector\n15\nApril 2025 | \n\nAbout PwC India’s ESG practice \nPwC’s ESG platform enables clients to navigate the evolving ecosystem around ESG strategy, reporting, climate \nchange, circular economy, technology, governance, social elements of ESG, sustainable supply chain, \nsustainable finance, capacity building and responsible investments.

India, standing at the cusp of a pivotal economic and demographic shift, \nis well-positioned to cater to the global demand for talent. \nThe report, ‘Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic \ndividend’, aims to contribute to the dialogue and highlight India’s role in shaping the future of work and labour force \nmobility. It outlines important policy recommendations to address the key barriers in labour migration pathways and \nenhance international dialogue and cooperation to maximise the economic benefits of labour mobility, thereby help \nnurture prosperity for the global economy. \nWhile the idea of promoting fair labour migration and mobility is not new, its criticality has gained prominence as the \nworld stands at the crossroads of massive economic, geopolitical and technological transformations. This report aims to \nserve the role of a strategic reference for policymakers, industry leaders, the academia and other stakeholders engaged \nin shaping workforce migration policies, frameworks and development strategies across the globe.\nSamir Saran\nPresident\nObserver Research Foundation\nsamir@orfonline.org\nSanjeev Krishan\nChairperson\nPwC India\nsanjeev.krishan@pwc.com \n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n5\nGlobal labour migration has been instrumental in shaping \nhow societies are formed and how economies function. \nSince the establishment of ancient trade routes to \npresent day, labour migration has been an important \nfactor in defining global geopolitical dynamics and \nshaping the socioeconomic fabric. Though labour \nmigration is typically influenced by employment \nopportunities and earning potential, factors such as \neconomic stability, geopolitical dynamics, national \nsecurity concerns and the pursuit of higher living \nstandards are also gaining prominence in influencing the \nworkforce’s decision. \nGlobal workforce, therefore, stands at a crossroad where \nglobal labour migration landscape is dotted with multiple \nchallenges and requires a unified policy framework, \ncoordinated international support and efforts for aiding \nlabour migration flow across the world and to leverage \nhuman capital for global growth and prosperity. The key \nchallenges that the world is witnessing today in the \ncontext of labour migration are multidimensional, \nspanning across policy and regulatory hurdles, including \nlack of adequate social security mechanisms, inadequate \nskill recognition and skill mismatch, short-term \nemployment contracts and low social, cultural and \npolitical receptiveness. \nAgainst this backdrop, this paper attempts to provide a \ncomprehensive understanding of the global labour \nmigration landscape with a focus on the underlying \neconomic frameworks and cross-country evidence of \nevolving labour migration patterns, its socio-economic \nimplications and how India's demographic dividend can \nbe leveraged in this context.\nThe first chapter looks at the dual role of labour – a \ncrucial production factor and a demand driver – and its \ncomplementary relationship with technology in \naugmenting economic output and sustainable growth. \nThe chapter enumerates the evolution of global labour \nmigration patterns shaped by social, economic, political \nand technological factors as well as the structural shifts in \nlabour migration patterns in the recent decade driven by \ntechnological advancements. It also examines the \nchallenges and opportunities related to global labour \nmigration, setting the context for a detailed discussion in \nthe later chapters. \nThe second chapter looks at the evolution of labour \nmigration theories, driven by factors like population \nchanges, differential wages and technological changes. \nIt explains the tenets of a fundamental model of global \nlabour migration and talks about both the economic and \nsocial benefits of global labour migration, including skills \ntransfer, entrepreneurship, innovation, remittances and \nhigher gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\nThe third chapter highlights the evolving labour migration \ntrends, with an analysis of immigration policies in key \ndestination countries like the United Arab Emirates \n(UAE) and the United States (US). It also looks at \nframeworks like ASEAN Qualifications Reference \nFramework (AQRF) and European initiatives like the \nEuropass which aids labour migration across the world. \nThe fourth chapter discusses the key challenges to \nlabour migration, ranging from cultural and social barriers \nto institutional impediments like the absence of bilateral \nand multilateral diplomatic agreements. The chapter also \nhighlights concepts like the ‘lottery of birth’,1 \nencapsulating the inherent advantages or disadvantages \nmigrants face due to their birthplace. The fifth chapter \nfocusses on India, underpinning its crucial position in the \nglobal labour migration landscape and identifying trends \nin Indian labour migration, while also detailing the \ncountry’s public and private sector initiatives aimed at \nfacilitating international labour mobility.\nThe sixth chapter looks at the convergence of labour \neconomics and international relations, highlighting the \nneed for institutional arrangements to attain an \nequilibrium in global labour supply and demand. \nFurthermore, it enumerates how Indian labour markets \ncan assume an important role in the global workforce \nlandscape by aligning with global policies and \ninstitutional frameworks to fully leverage the economic \npotential of labour migration for both the domestic and \nglobal economy.\nThe seventh chapter maps global labour opportunities, \nemphasising India's role in addressing workforce \nshortages in mature economies like Germany, Japan, \nand Canada. The section highlights how barriers such as \nskill mismatches, regulatory complexities, and \nqualification recognition persist and can be mitigated by \nstrengthening skilling initiatives, aligning certifications \nwith global standards, and leveraging AI-driven training \nplatforms. Lastly, the concluding chapter on policy \nrecommendations highlights how a sustainable \nworkforce mobility framework necessitates robust \nalignment between domestic skill development initiatives \nand evolving international labour demands. A dynamic, \nfuture-ready labour mobility strategy can position India \nas a leading global talent supplier while maximising \nreciprocal economic benefits.\n1 Note: Lottery of birth refers to the concept that the circumstances into which a person is born—such as location, time, family and societal context \nare matters of chance which can significantly influence their life opportunities and outcomes.\nIntroduction\n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n6\n1.1 Labour as a critical input\nLabour has been a crucial and indispensable force \nthroughout every phase of economic evolution, acting as \nthe backbone of production, growth and economic \ndevelopment. It is not only a critical factor of production, \nresilient to waves of industrial and technological \nrevolution but has also been pivotal to global \nsocioeconomic transformations. Labour is the only factor \nof production that serves a dual role, both as an input in \nproduction and as a consumer influencing the demand \nfor production. \nThis criticality of labour has largely remained unchanged \neven in the wake of watershed moments in the global \nindustrial order. The first Industrial Revolution led to a \nshift in labour force from primary to secondary sectors, as \nthe invention of steam engine boosted labour productivity \nby significantly lowering the dependence on manual \nlabour. The second and third Industrial Revolution, pivotal \non technological innovation further increased the demand \nfor skilled labour. \nIn the current context, while digital disruption and \nautomation has enhanced labour productivity, labour in \nturn has been driving such innovation, critical thinking \nand decision-making. On the one hand, technological \nprogress has enhanced labour productivity by largely \neliminating low end jobs, streamlining tasks and \nprocesses and enabling workers to generate more output \nwith the same level of man-hours. Meanwhile on the \nother, labour, by the virtue of its human intelligence, \ncreativity, critical thinking and agility has been at the \nforefront of this technology revolution. Thus, in this ever-\nchanging landscape, the role of labour is increasingly \nbecoming more complex and essential in aiding \neconomic output.\n01\nLabour as a global resource\nThe relationship between labour and technology is more \ncomplementary than substitutive, with each playing an \nindispensable role in supporting economic momentum. \nThe essence of this relationship has been underscored in \nthe endogenous economic growth model,2 which \nconsiders labour as a complementary input to technology \nin production. \n1.2 International labour migration as \na leveller\nInternational labour migration has been a crucial factor in \nshaping economies, societies and cultures across the \nglobe throughout history. Beginning with the \nestablishment of maritime trade routes centuries ago to \nthe expansion of global networks in the modern times, \nglobal labour migration continues to influence geopolitical \ndevelopments as well as the socioeconomic fabric \nacross the globe. In the current context, global labour \nmigration is an important concern driven by a slew of \neconomic, social, geopolitical and cultural factors. This \nsection discusses the current trends in global \nlabour migration. \n2 Paul M Romer, Endogenous technological change.

(3rd ed.) \n4 United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2024). International Migrant Stock 2024 \nDelving deeper, the gender gap among international \nmigrants has been widening in the last 20 years. In 2000, \nthe gender distribution of global migrants was nearly \nequal. However, by 2024, this gap widened, with males \ncomprising 52% and females 48% of the migrant \npopulation.4\nFrom a regional perspective, North America, Europe, \nand the Gulf countries are the most preferred destination \nfor migrant workers, due to better economic \nopportunities, political stability and higher living \nstandards. Conversely, regions experiencing conflict, \neconomic hardship or environmental challenges are \nseeing higher emigration rates. \nIndia’s role in international labour migration\nIndia holds a unique position in the narrative of \ninternational labour migration. The phenomenon of global \nemigration of Indian has deeper historical roots and has \nbeen constantly evolving in response to global economic \nand geopolitical dynamics.\nEconomic factors played an important role in shaping \nIndia’s labour emigration patterns. The oil boom in the \nMiddle East during 1970-1980 led to a plethora of \neconomic opportunities in the construction and low-\nskilled services sector. This led to a significant \nimmigration of Indian labour to the Gulf countries. There \nwas also a significant increase in the emigration of highly \nskilled labour to developed countries like the US, \nCanada, the United Kingdom and Australia in sectors \nsuch as medicine, healthcare, information technology \n(IT) and engineering. The period witnessed a sizable \nemigration of Indian medical professionals to the US due \nto the expanding healthcare sector in the country as \nalong with the implementation of several favourable \nimmigration policies. \nFurthermore, the booming IT sector in the US during the \n1990s also attracted high skilled Indian IT professionals. \nThe period saw many Indians, driven by better economic \nopportunities and living standards seeking permanent \nresidency or citizenship in the US.\nIn the recent decades, on the one hand, Gulf countries \nare largely attracting unskilled and semi-skilled Indian \nlabour due to the high demand for labour in the region’s \nfast expanding infrastructure and construction sectors, \nand low-end services and on the other hand, developed \neconomies like the US, Canada and countries of the \nEuropean Union have been a popular location for highly \nskilled Indian labour migrants. \nIn the coming years, as global labour force migration \nmay continue to increase, India’s international labour \nmigration landscape is poised to evolve further in \nresponse to technological evolution, enhanced digital \nconnectivity, climate changes and demographic \ntransitions. Global demand for skilled labour is expected \nto strengthen, offering enhanced opportunities for Indian \nlabour in emerging sectors like artificial intelligence, \nrenewable energy and biotechnology. \nData from International Labour Organisation (ILO) reveals \nthat as of 2019, total international migrant workers across \nthe globe stood at 169 million accounting for 4.9% of the \nglobal labour force. From a gender perspective, there \nwere 99 million male workers and 70 million female \nworkers.3\nFigure 2 shows an increasing trend in overall global \nmigration.\nFigure 2: Number of international migrants from 1990 \nto 2024 (in millions)\n154\n163\n175\n193\n221\n250\n275\n304\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2024\nSource: United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, \nPopulation Division (2024).

This suggests \ngreater redistribution of labour resources across the \nglobe, addressing issues of labour and skill shortages \nand demographic disparities. From an economic \nperspective, this aides economic growth in host countries \nthrough more productive labour allocation and supported \ndevelopment in home countries through higher \nremittance inflow. \nFigure 3 corroborates that global migration has been \nincreasing at a faster pace than the increase in total \nworld population over the last three decades.

The confluence of emerging \ntechnologies like AI, big data, Internet of Things (IoT) and \nblockchain computing, coined under the umbrella of the \nfourth Industrial Revolution, (Industry 4.0) has led to \nparadigm changes in the labour market landscape \nworldwide. There has been an increasing trend in \nde-linking of labour from its services – a shift away from \ntraditional long-term, location-based labour employment \nto task-based service delivery that can be performed by a \nlabour virtually without the need of any \nphysical presence.\nAided by the digital wave, the rise of gig economy \n(freelancing and part time work) and emergence of digital \nplatforms enabled outsourcing of jobs – mainly contract-\nbased tasks to a large global workforce beyond \ngeographical boundaries. This helped skilled workers in \ndeveloping economies in pursuit of higher income \nopportunities to access global jobs from a remote \nlocation without the need of any physical movement, thus \neliminating the existing geographical and \ngeopolitical constraints. This de-linking of labour and its \nservices has helped in increasing the outreach and \nemployability of global labour force, thus offering \nbusinesses access to a much wider global labour pool \nand providing workers a global market for their skills.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent lockdowns \nwhich led to disruptions in economic activity further \nstrengthened this transformation. Remote working \npractices increased sharply in low contact-intensive \nsectors like professional services and information \ntechnology during this period. However, its noteworthy \nthat the trend of remote work in some of the sectors has \npersisted even in the post-pandemic period.\nFigure 4 shows a sharp increase in jobs that can be \nperformed remotely (as percentage of total jobs) in \nthe US. This was triggered by the widespread lockdowns \nafter the COVID-19 pandemic. The share decreased in \n2022 as economic activity and business operations \nmoved towards normalcy, resulting in many workers \nresuming working from offices, particularly in more \nlabour-intensive sectors. Despite the decline, the share of \nremotely performed work in 2022 remained significantly \nhigher than the pre-pandemic levels, highlighting a more \nstructural shift underway. \nThis change in work and employment pattern has also \nled to a structural transformation in migration patterns, \nwherein labour would offer its services to businesses \nacross geographical borders, without the need of any \nphysical movement. \nFigure 4: Percentage of remote work among US \nworkers by major industry group (top 10 industries) \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\nProfessional, scientific, and\ntechnical services\nInformation\nFinance and insurance\nManagement of companies\nand enterprises\nReal estate and rental and\nleasing\nEducational services\nAdministrative and waste\nmanagement services\nUtilities\nArts, entertainment, and\nrecreation\nWholesale trade\n2019\n2021\n2022\nSource: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, The rise in remote work since \nthe pandemic and its impact on productivity\nThis trend in global labour migration will likely sustain as \ndigital jobs and remote working opportunities continue to \ngain traction.5 According to a World Economic Forum \nreport, businesses expect around 42% of all tasks to be \nautomated by the year 2027.6 Similarly, according to \nanother report, digital jobs are expected to increase by \naround 25% by 2030, thus creating huge disruptions in \nthe global labour-market.7 These trends underscore a \ncohesive mix of increasing job opportunities in emerging \nand high skill domains with a gradual phasing out of \nseveral existing low and medium skilled manual tasks, \nthat will likely be automated. Thus, while low end tasks – \nthe ones which employ unskilled and low-skilled labour \nincluding migrant labour – may decline, high skill jobs are \nlikely to gain prominence, thus facilitating greater \nmigration of niche skills and expertise across countries. \nParticularly developed economies, with thriving service \nsector will continue to attract skilled labour but the \nincreasing possibilities of delinking of labour and its \nservices, will likely result in migration of skills across the \nglobe, without cross border physical movement of labour.\nProfessional, scientific and \ntechnical services\nInformation technology\nFinance and insurance\nManagement of companies \nand enterprises \nReal estate and \nrental and leasing \nEducational services \nAdministrative and waste \nmanagement services\nUtilities\nArts, entertainment, \nand recreation\nWholesale trade\n5 World Economic Forum, The Future of Jobs Report 2023 \n6 World Economic Forum, The Future of Jobs Report 2023 \n7 World Economic Forum, The Rise of Global Digital Jobs. White paper January 2024 \n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n9\nWhile the emergence of a wide spectrum of new job roles \noffers increased opportunities for the labour force, it also \nbrings with it new challenges. For example, gig work may \ninvolve irregular and out of routine working hours, \nirregular payment, short-term contracts, wage \ndiscrimination and in several cases, no job security. This \nis largely due to the evolving nature of such jobs and the \nabsence of well-crafted labour regulations pertaining to \nthe same. \nTherefore, it is crucial to adopt a holistic policy approach \nto these structural changes. A detailed understanding of \nthe evolving trends in global labour demand and supply \nand migration patterns is key to the effective formulation \nof future migration policies across countries. Adapting \npolicies, including revising work visa requirements, \nrevamping hiring process for skilled migrants and \ndesigning a facilitating labour migration framework may \nhelp in addressing the current challenges and manage \nthis transition well.\n1.4 Challenges and opportunities in global \nlabour markets\nGlobal labour markets are facing a myriad of challenges. \nEconomic volatility, informal employment and \nunderemployment, skill mismatches, demographic shifts \nand wage compression are some of the issues that \nwarrant well-designed mitigating measures. However, on \nthe brighter side, opportunities related to technological \nprogress, remote working alternatives, move towards \nsustainable growth and focus on up-skilling are plenty. \nLeveraging these opportunities would require supportive \npolicies, favourable regulatory framework and \ninternational cooperation to ensure a robust, resilient and \ninclusive global labour markets. The following section \ndiscusses some of the key trends, which pose challenges \nand, if leveraged well, can translate into opportunities for \nglobal labour migration. \nUnemployment and underemployment: The global \nlabour market is fragmented and diverse, with low and \nmiddle-income countries coping with high unemployment \nlevels, while high-income countries are facing labour \nshortages in many sectors. While global unemployment \nrate stood at 5.1% in 2023, well below the pre-pandemic \nlevels, there are huge underlying disparities – high-\nincome countries have an unemployment rate of 4.5%, \ncompared to 5.7% in low-income countries.8 Supportive \nframeworks facilitating cross-border labour migration \ncould help reduce these imbalances, providing \nsocioeconomic benefits to both the migrant-sending as \nwell as the receiving countries and optimising \nemployment levels worldwide.\nSkills mismatch: Any gap between workers' skills and \njob requirements results in underemployment and \ninefficiencies, weighing on economic growth and \ninnovation. A report by World Economic Forum reveals \nthat 60% of companies outlined local skills gaps as a \nmajor barrier to transformation, and 53% struggle to \nattract talent.9 \nDemographic shifts: The proportion of older workers \naged 55 to 64 in the global labour force has been on a \nsteady rise and is likely to increase further till 2030. This \ntrend is predominant in both emerging and developed \neconomies, where older workers is expected to account \nfor 13.2% and 17.7% of the total workforce, respectively. \nThis is sharply higher than the share of 7.9% in \ndeveloping economies.10 Thus, while developed \neconomies are facing demographic challenges, most of \nthe developing economies are reaping the benefits of \nhaving a relatively younger population, offering a \npotential demographic dividend. Global migration and \nproductive employment of young labour from labour rich \ndeveloping economies to the advanced economies \nwitnessing labour shortages can help rejuvenate their \nworkforces and support economic output and \nsustainable growth.\nUndocumented migration and labour markets: \nUndocumented migration is increasingly undermining \nlegal migration frameworks, adversely impacting public \nresources, triggering anti-migration sentiments and \nresulting in restrictive immigration policies. The conflation \nof regular and irregular migration in political dialogue has \nexacerbated negative public perceptions, resulting in \nregulatory frameworks and policies that make legal \nmigration more bureaucratic, expensive and difficult even \nwhen host countries face labour shortages in high skills \nsectors like healthcare and technology. Governments \nmust balance national security concerns with economic \nneeds by implementing more transparent migration \npolicies which can facilitate legal migration. Additionally, \ninternational dialogue and cooperation is essential to \naddress the critical issue of forced migration to ensure \nthat labour migration helps in achieving shared \nprosperity across the globe.\nTechnological and structural shifts: Remote working \npractices and emergence of digital jobs have reshaped \nthe global labour landscape, bringing in \nparadigm changes. The automation of low-skilled tasks \nhas weighed on demand for low skilled labour but at the \nsame time has generated many high-skilled and \nspecialised jobs, creating opportunities for cross-border \nskill migration. By adequately capitalising this \ntechnological change, identifying key skill areas and \nproviding quality skills trainings, countries can foster a \nmore skilled, inclusive and empowered global workforce, \nleveraging labour migration for global economic and \nsocial enhancement.\nThe global labour market is going through a \ntransformative phase driven by a plethora of \ntechnological, demographic socioeconomic and \ngeopolitical factors. Adequately understanding these \nchanges, addressing the imminent challenges and \nleveraging the opportunities requires collaboration \nbetween governments, policy makers, private sector, \neducational institutions and the society at large to foster \ninclusive, equitable and supportable labour \nmarket policies.\n8 ILO World employment and social outlook: Trends 2024.

ILO Working \nPaper 5 \n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n10\n2.1 Economics of immigration: \nA multifaceted analysis\nThe United Nations defines international migrant as ‘any \nperson who has changed his or her country of \nresidence.’11 This broad definition includes individuals \nwho move for different reasons, for example, better \neconomic opportunities, family reunification, education or \nfleeing geopolitical conflict. Meanwhile, focusing on \nlabour aspect of migration, the International Labour \nOrganization (ILO) defines a labour migrant as ‘a person \nwho is to be engaged or has been engaged in a \nremunerated activity in a state of which he or she is not a \nnational.’12 Labour migration is a substantial part of global \nmigration, driven by the demand for labour across \ndifferent geographic regions and sectors. \nLabour migration can be influenced by a slew of \neconomic or non-economic factors. This section \ndiscusses the evolution of theoretical frameworks of \nglobal migration, assessing the drivers of migration and \nproviding evidence of their empirical veracity. \nMigration drivers can be broadly categorised into two \nfactors – push and pull. Push factors are conditions which \ninfluence people to leave their home region or workplace, \nwhile pull factors are attributes of a destination that \nattract workers to migrate to that area. Low wages, \neconomic instability, geopolitical conflicts, poor social \nbenefits are some of the most common push factors. \n02\nBenefits of global workforce migration\nSimilarly, higher wages, attractive welfare programmes, \npolitical stability, better working conditions in the \ndestination region are pull factors which can motivate \nworkers to migrate. Migration decisions are also \ninfluenced by the relative difference in expected utility \nwhich is affected by both push and pull factors. The \nfollowing section discusses how economic theory has \nconceptualised migration, evolving from the Neoclassical \nframework to broader, heterodox frameworks.\nEarly economic models from the classical school \nconsidered population growth as a binding constraint for \neconomic progress due to limited resources, land in \nparticular. However, the economic boom in the \nimmigrant-receiving countries like the US, Canada, and \nAustralia in the 9th century contradicted this school of \nthrough, highlighting that immigration aids growth rather \nthan hindering it. As economic thought evolved, the \nNeoclassical School, particularly through the Solow \ngrowth model13 highlighted the importance of \ntechnological progress as the key driver of long-term \neconomic growth. The model also underscores the \ncrucial role of human capital in enhancing a country's \ntechnological capabilities and growth potential. This \nframework remains highly relevant in the current context, \nwherein technology adoption and innovation are key to \ncontinuing competitiveness and migration of skilled \nworkers has been at the fulcrum of global \nlabour migration.\n11 United Nations.

Solow in 1957. The Solow growth model shows \nhow capital, population growth, and technological progress affect the level of an economy’s output and its growth over time.\n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n11\n14 John R.

If they are complementary to each-other, wage in fact might increase. \nEmpirical evidence shows that there is null or slightly positive impact on wage and employment on native workers due to immigration. Hence, this \nmodel highlights that even when we assume negative impact in labour market of destination countries, there is larger global gain to achieve through \nfree flow of labour migration. \n19 Anthony Edo. 2019. “The Impact of Immigration on the labour market”. Journal of Economic Surveys. Volume33, Issue3. \nThe later models of labour migration, like the one \nconceptualised by Harris and Todaro,14 further explain \nsome of the current migration dynamics. Unlike traditional \nmodels which assume that migration would stop once \nwage differences are eliminated, this framework \nconsiders other factors, such as employment probability \nand urban-rural disparities, to provide a more thorough \nunderstanding of why migration may persist even when \nwage gaps are minimised. In today's world, labour \nmigration is driven not just by wage differentials but also \nby factors like employment opportunities, expected wage \ndifferences rather than actual, quality of life, access to \nhealthcare and education, and social and \npolitical stability. \nThe endogenous growth model15 highlights the \nsignificance of skilled migrants in complementing \ntechnology and driving innovation. As a reflection, recent \nmigration policies in many countries have increasingly \nprioritised attracting skilled talent. \nAdditional theories also explain the evolving migration \npatterns. For instance, the dual or segmented labour \nmarket theory16 highlights how macroeconomic aspects, \nsuch as industrial transformations in developed countries \ncreate pull factors for migration. The world systems \ntheory17 illustrates how developed countries seek labour \nfrom developing regions, shaping global migration routes. \nWhile the contemporary economic theories may differ in \ntheir theoretical essence, they largely highlight that labour \nmigration is driven by a range of multifaceted factors \nbeyond wage differences and that industrial and \ntechnology changes and established migrant \ncommunities play a key role in determining and \nsustaining global migration patterns while boosting \neconomic growth.\n2.2 An economic framework of global labour \nmigration\nTo understand how free flow of labour migration from \nlabour-endowed economy to labour deficit-economy can \nboost global economic welfare, we look at a basic \neconomic model of global labour migration. The model \nassumes free cross-border movement of labour across \nthe world. As labour migration increases, the increased \nlabour supply in the destination country results in a \nreduction in wages there,18 while the reduced supply in \nthe origin country leads to wage increases.19 Immigrants \nbenefit from higher wages in the destination country \ncompared to the origin country and domestic workers in \nthe origin country see wage growth due to fewer workers. \nSource: Taken from Book: Cynthia Bansak Zebedee, Nicole Simpson, \nMadeline Zavodny. 2020. “The Economics of Immigration”. 2nd \nEdition. Routledge\nFigure 5 depicts the labour market graphs for both the \ndestination and origin countries. The vertical axis on the \nleft-side shows the wage in the destination country, \nwhile the vertical axis on the right-side shows the wage \nin the origin country. The horizontal axis measures the \nnumber of workers in the destination from left to right, \nand the number of workers in the origin from right to left. \nThe stock of labour across both countries is represented \nby L, full length of the horizontal axis. In each country, \nlabour demand is driven by the value of workers \nmarginal product. The demand for labour is greater in \nthe destination country than in the origin country, as \nindicated by the higher vertical intercept of DD \ncompared to DO. This shows that workers are more \nproductive in the destination country.\nAlthough native-born workers in the destination country \nmay experience a slight wage decrease, the overall \nsocietal gains from migration outweigh the losses.\nFigure 5: Destination and origin labour market \nequilibrium pre-and post-immigration\nWage in \ndestination\nWage in \norigin\nW*\nWO\nWD\nW*\nA\nB\nC\nDD\nD\nE\nI\nJ\nC\nH\nH\nG\nG\nF\nDO\nL\nLabor in \ndestination\nLabor in \norigin\nL1\nL*\n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n12\nTable 1: Net gain from immigration\nGroup\nWithout \nimmigration\nWith \nimmigration\nGain \n(or loss)\nImmigrants\nJ\nJ+E+I\nE+I\nDestination \ncountry: \nCompeting \nworkers\nB+C\nC\nB\nOther factors \nof production\nA\nA+B+D\nB+D\nOrigin \ncountry: \nCompeting \nworkers\nH\nH+G\nGain \n(or loss)\nOther factors \nof production\nF+G+I\nF\n- (G + I)\nNet gains due \nto immigration\nD+E\nSource: Taken from Book: Cynthia Bansak Zebedee, Nicole Simpson, \nMadeline Zavodny. 2020. “The Economics of Immigration”. 2nd \nEdition. Routledge \nAs is evident from the model, there is a global gain \nachieved by moving labour across borders. \nBusinesses and enterprises in the destination countries \ntend to reap substantial benefits from labour immigration \nwhich can be reinvested to further expand capacity and \noutput in subsequent periods. This expansion, in turn, \ncontinues to attract more migrants. In a scenario of \nunrestricted global labour movement, this cycle \nperpetuates and accelerates economic growth for both \nthe origin and destination countries, thus enhancing the \noverall growth potential of the global economy. \n2.3 Benefits of labour migration\nThis section discusses the empirical evidence of the \nbenefits and positive spillovers of global labour \nmigration, substantiating the theoretical framework \ndiscussed in the previous section. \nWorkforce migration offers a slew of benefits for both the \ndestination as well as the origin country. For the host \neconomy, it helps in bridging labour shortages and \nproductivity differential. Cross-border movement of \nskilled workers enables transfer of knowledge to host \neconomies, which boosts innovation and global \ncompetitiveness. For the origin country, labour migration \nensures a steady inflow of remittances income, a crucial \ntool aiding in poverty alleviation and economic stability. \nOverall, the diverse perspectives and experiences of \nmigrant workers also help in fostering technological \nprogress, business dynamism and entrepreneurial \nexcellence in the home country.\nTherefore, the net gain from immigration is the area \nD + E. The breakdown of this gain is given in Table 1.\nPre-immigration equilibrium\nThe pre- immigration labour market equilibrium in the \ndestination is L1 workers and wage WD in destination, \nand LO = L − L1 workers and wage WO in the origin.\nOpen global labour migration\nIn a scenario of open labour migration, workers relocate \nuntil wages are equal in both countries. This equilibrium \nis reached at the point where the labour supply intersects \nwith the labour demand in each country (L*). Workers \ncontinue to move until the wages in both countries are \nequalised, resulting in WD = WO = W* at equilibrium. \nThe wage in the destination country decreases from WD \nto W*. Conversely, in the origin country, the wage \nincreases from WO to W*. While the theoretical model is \nbased on an assumption of no labour migration barriers, \nin reality, the existence of geopolitical and social barriers \nhas hindered wage equalisation in many regions, \nparticularly between low- and high-income countries.\nGain for the immigrant\nImmigrants benefit by earning higher wage. Due to labour \nmigration, immigrant workers gain areas E and I. Before \nmigrating, they earned area J, but after migration, their \nincome increases to E + I + J.\nGain/loss for the destination\nNative-born workers in the destination country are \ndisadvantaged because their wages decrease. Prior to \nimmigration, these workers earned areas B + C. \nHowever, after immigration, their earnings drop to just \narea C. Meanwhile, other production factors in the \ndestination, like capital owners, initially earn area A. \nFollowing immigration, their earnings increase to \nA + B + D.\nGain/loss for origin country\nIn the origin country, wages rise due to the outflow of \nworkers. Before immigration, the workers who stay \nbehind (those who do not migrate) earn area H. After \nimmigration, their earnings increase to G + H, resulting in \na gain of area G. Initially, other production factors in the \norigin country earn F + G + I, but after immigration, their \nearnings decrease to area F.\n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n13\nLabour migration due to difference in wage rates can \ngenerate an overall larger pie for the economy and \neasing immigration restriction can be an effective way \nto reduce global income disparities. A study argues that \nthe potential gains from easing immigration restrictions \ncould be much higher than that from easing barriers to \ntrade or capital flows. The estimated gains from \neliminating barriers to labour mobility could result in \ngains ranging from 50% to 150% of world GDP, much \nhigher than the expected gains from removing cross \nborder trade and capital flow barriers.20 The broader \neconomic gains from labour migration are \nencapsulated below.\nSkills and innovation: Global labour migration \ncontributes to skill enhancement and innovation by \nattracting diverse talent and highly skilled labour to host \ncountries. High-skilled migrants, especially in STEM \nfields, aid patent activity and technological innovations. \nFor instance, a 1% point increase in the share of \nimmigrant college graduates in the US correlates with a \n15% rise in patents per capita.21 While foreign-born \ninventors make up 16% of the US inventor population, \nthey account for 23% of combined innovation output in \nthe US (estimated using the number of patents filed, \neconomic value of such patents and their citations).22 \n20 Michael Clemens. 2011. “Economics and Emigration: Trillion-Dollar Bills on the Sidewalk?” Journal of Economic perspective, 25(3):83-106 \n21 Jennifer Hunt and Marjolaine Gauthier-Loiselle. 2010. “How much does immigration boost innovation”.

In the US, immigrants own 16% \nof high-tech firms and are 80% more likely to start new \nbusinesses compared to those born in the US. \nImmigrants are also founders of more than half of the \nstartups in US that reach a valuation of USD 1 billion.26 \nFurther, around 45% of the companies that featured in \nthe New American Fortune 500 list in 2023, were \nfounded by either immigrants or their children.27 In \ndeveloping countries, remittances from migrants are \ncritical for funding entrepreneurial ventures. \n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n14\nDemographic enrichment: Migrants play a vital role in \nfilling labour force gaps in destination countries, \nespecially in sectors with shortages of local workers, \nwhile providing employment for disguised worker in \norigin. This demographic boost is essential for aging \nsocieties that need a steady influx of younger workers to \nsustain economic growth. In regions like Latin America \nand the Caribbean, where the population aged 60 and \nolder is projected to double by 2050, labour migration is \ncrucial for sustaining economic and social vitality.28\nRemittances: World Bank’s report reveals a significant \nrise in international remittances, from USD 128 billion in \n2000 to USD 857 billion in 2023. Low- and middle-\nincome countries are the primary beneficiaries of \nremittance flows while high-income countries like the US, \nSaudi Arabia and Switzerland are the main sources of \nremittances. In 2023, India, Mexico, China, the \nPhilippines and Pakistan were the top five recipient \ncountries for remittances inflows. 29\nEconomic growth: Global labour migration has been a \nstrong driver of economic growth, both for the destination \nas well as the origin economy. Migrants contribute \nsizably to their host countries' GDP through increased \nlabour force participation, labour productivity, \ninnovations, entrepreneurship and consumption while \nalso sending remittances that boost their home countries' \neconomies. For example, in the European Union, non-EU \ncitizens have filled essential roles, helping alleviate \nlabour shortages and increase economic output. ASEAN \ncountries like Thailand and Malaysia witness substantial \ncontributions from migrant labour, driving economic \nexpansion in diverse sectors.\n28 IOM UN Migration, The 3 Benefits of International Migration That Transform Economies and Societies Around the World \n29 World Bank Migration Data Portal\n30 IMF World Economic Outlook, April 2020: The Great Lockdown \n31 IMF World Economic Outlook, April 2020: The Great Lockdown\n32 World Bank Migration Data Portal \nA closer look at the episodes characterised by large \nwaves of immigration suggests positive economic impact \nof labour migration on destination countries. A study by \nIMF estimates that a 1% point increase in the inflow of \nimmigrants relative to total employment in advanced \neconomies increases output by almost 1% by the fifth \nyear.30 Furthermore, a simulation exercise conducted by \nthe IMF for the period from 2020 to 2050 shows that \nwhile the growth in the native population is likely to \nincrease global GDP by roughly 4% (from the baseline) \nbetween 2020 and 2050, labour migration flows could \ncontribute to an additional 2% to global growth.31 \nThus, the economic benefits of labour migration are \nmanifold, substantially impacting global and regional \neconomies. High-skilled migrants enhance innovation \nand entrepreneurship, evidenced by their substantial \ncontributions to patents and business startups in \ncountries like the US. Remittances from migrants, which \nsurged to USD 857 billion globally in 2023,32 play a \ncritical role in supporting economies in low- and middle-\nincome countries. Overall, global labour migration has \npositive impacts on economic growth, with studies \nsignalling that large immigration waves have historically \nboosted the economies of destination countries. A study \nby IMF estimates that a 1% point increase in the inflow of \nimmigrants relative to total employment in advanced \neconomies increases output by almost 1% by the \nfifth year.\n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n15\n3.1 Global overview of migration patterns\nThe growing global migrant stock33 reflects the surge in \nthe numbers of immigrants residing in destination \ncountries. As per the data from a United Nations’ report, \nthe volume of persons living outside their country of \norigin peaked at 204 million in 2024 (3.7% of the world’s \ntotal population; 60% international migrant workers) from \nnearly 221 million in 2010 (38% increase) due to \neconomic, socio-economic, geopolitical, and \nenvironmental advancements.34, 35\nFigure 6: Trends for international migration stock \n(1990-2024 in millions)\n03\nCurrent dynamics of global workforce \nmigration\nWorkforce migration: Linking low, middle and high \nincome groups \nAn important trend can be observed regarding origin of \n181 million (60%) international migrants from middle \nincome countries in 202436 in order to pursue better \nemployment opportunities and pull factor of \ncomparatively high monetary compensation in high \nincome countries. Since the last 20 years, high income \ncountries have steadily emerged as the preferred \ndestination countries of immigrants from middle income \ncountries particularly. More than 199 million (65%) live in \nhigh income countries and around 89 million (29%) \nreside in middle-income countries. and around 14.3 \nmillion (4.7%) in low-income countries. Among the high \nincome countries, the largest number of migrants live in \nEurope followed by Northern Africa and Western Asia.\nFurther, international migration trends reveal a steady \nflow of migrants in high income countries (with the US, \nGermany and Saudi Arabia emerging as top \ndestinations). Key countries of origin include India, \nfollowed by China and Mexico. These patterns are \nenabled by economic opportunities, education prospects \nand family reunification, thereby reflecting a strong \nSouth-to-North migration trend. Additionally, intra-\nregional migration can also be observed, especially \nwithin Europe and Africa, led by geographic proximity \nand shared socio-economic ties.\n33 Note: Migrant stock is a static measure of the number of persons that can be identified as international migrants at a given time\n34 International Organization for Migration (IOM).

When bilateral relations are strong between the nations, issues faced by the immigrants are streamlined \nthrough effected channels, thereby facilitating the requirements of both host and destination countries, as the immigrant’s \nconcerns are steadily catered to. Some examples which highlight the impact of weak institutional frameworks are:\n04\nBarriers to global workforce mobility \n45 International Labour Organization (ILO).

One of the challenges which emerges with \nglobal workforce migration is streamlining and \nbenchmarking the existing skillsets of the workforce in \nboth destination and host countries. This can be further \ncomplicated in situations wherein international reference \nframeworks are not available. \nFor individuals, this results in significant wage penalties \nand low returns in investments with respect to their \neducational qualifications while businesses are impacted \nin terms of turnover and workforce productivity. This \nhighlights the emergent need to adapt a common \ninternational reference framework globally to cater to the \nemerging global skill gaps and enhance labour mobility \n(ILO,2023).49 \n4.3 Barriers emerging out of cultural \ndiversities\nIt has been observed that migrants face issues in \nintegration due to low understanding of the cultures in the \ndestination countries in cases where cultural sensitivity \ntraining is not covered in pre-departure trainings. Due to \nlimited proficiency in linguistic standards, communication \nis also affected both at the personal and \nprofessional front. \nEmployers are also reluctant to hire workforce who have \nlow fluency in the local language in the destination \ncountry as this could impact work and increase the \npossibility of errors and conflicts at workplace. This is \nperceived as discrimination at the time of hiring process \nby immigrants affecting their accessibility to their \nemployment and successful integration. \n4.4 Channels for high-cost remittances\nRemittances emerge as an important channel for foreign \nexchange earnings across many low- and middle-income \ncountries (LMICs) in the Asia and Pacific region and have \nan impact on the household incomes and overall \nlivelihood including life quality. This trend has increased \nsignificantly after the COVID-19 pandemic as foreign \ndirect investments flow has slowed in LMICs.50 \nHowever, there exists a high cost for sending \nremittances by many migrants which acts as a barrier \nprimarily in developing regions. In the fourth quarter of \n2023, the global average cost of sending USD 200 was \n6.4%, which is 0.2 percentage points higher than the \nprevious year and more than double the target set by the \nSustainable Development Goal 10.c.1 of reducing \nremittance costs to 3%. This significantly points towards \nthe barriers existing in achieving lucrative remittance \ntransfers globally.51 \nAccording to the analysis of key channels for sending \nremittances globally, most expensive are the banks due \nto complex processes which at times are outdated and \ninvolves intermediary as well as conversion charges as \nper the respective currency. \nWhile comparatively less costly options are post offices \nand money transfer operators (MTOs) (average costs: \n7.7% and 5.5, respectively)52 Money transfer operators \nstands somewhere in middle while being affordable \ncomparatively with post office. Here, mobile operators \nemerged as the cheapest alternative. This trend points \ntowards the increase in the usage of mobile money \nservices which provide speedy transfers and low \noperational costs in comparison to other channels. This \nmay be further strengthened with enhancing scalability \nand internal availability particularly in remote areas for \nmass adoption.\n4.5 Two-pronged impact of ‘lottery of birth’ \n’Lottery of birth’53 plays an important role in deciding \nmigration success although migrant’s personal \ncapabilities and environment nurture their aspirations to \na large extent. This can impact workforce migration in \ntwo ways – displaced populations and the population \naffected by ineffective migration structures and \nprocesses. Due to lack of collaborative efforts by the \nrelevant stakeholders in the migration set up, potential \nmigrants are impacted due to complex migration \nprocesses. Some of the challenges related to this are \nnavigating visa processes and legal regulations, failure to \nsecure a work visa and valid sponsors.\n49 Wang, Zhiling, Peter Nijkamp, and Thomas de Graaff. 2019. \"Barriers of Culture, Networks, and Language in International Migration: A Review.\" \nGeoJournal 84 (1): 117–137 \n50 Clemens, Michael A., and Hannah M.

Harnessing the potential of India’s \ndemographic dividend\nIndia, having recently surpassed China as the world's \nmost populous country, is well-positioned to address the \nshortfalls in the labour markets of many advanced \neconomies. With a population exceeding 1.4 billion, \nnearly 65% of which are of working age (15-64 years) \nand over 27% aged 15 to 24, India's relatively young \ndemographic profile has the potential to create a \nsignificant, positive impact on the global labour market. \nAs one of the world's fastest-growing large economy, \nIndia boasts a GDP growth rate of 8.2% in 2023-24, \ndriven by strong private consumption and public \ninvestments. As a result, the country is now on track to \nachieve its ambitious target of becoming a USD 5 trillion \neconomy by 2026-27. 54\nGlobal workforce mobility can leverage India’s \ndemographic dividend to enable seamless cross-border \nmovement in professional and personal spheres. India’s \nlarge English-speaking, highly skilled workforce is a \ncritical asset which contributes to the economies of \ndestination countries. A substantial wealth of resources \nand AI skill penetration three times the global average \npositions India as a prominent contender in this \ntransformative field.55\n05\nLeveraging India’s demographic dividend\nHeavy investments in AI research and skilling \nprogrammes, coupled with initiatives such as the \nPradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), the \nSkill India Mission and Digital India aims to uplift millions \nby providing internationally standardised education \nand training.\nIndia's growing interest in developing and promoting \nregional and global economic partnerships underscores \nits readiness to facilitate the flow of skilled labour. For \ninstance, Germany's strategic focus on expanding \nmobility agreements highlights India's capacity to meet \nthe demands of digital and green economies.56 Similarly, \nIndia's collaboration with Japan under the Specified \nSkilled Worker programme addresses Japan’s labour \nshortages by empowering individuals for global \nopportunities.57\nThe global labour landscape is witnessing significant \ndemographic transitions owing to a substantial decline in \npopulation growth rates in advanced economies and, \ntherefore, a surge in their dependency ratios. Countries \nlike Germany, Italy, Japan and South Korea are \ngrappling with shrinking working-age populations, \nleading to commensurate reductions in labour supply and \nemployment rates and a slowdown in GDP growth rates. \nFor instance, in the EU, projections indicate that the \ncontribution of labour supply to economic growth will turn \nnegative as hours worked decrease.58\n54 https://pib.gov.in/Pressreleaseshare.aspx?PRID=1549454 \nSoumya Bhowmick, \"Bridging Global Workforce Gaps: An Indian Perspective.\" Observer Research Foundation, May 31, 2024. \n55 Wheebox, India Skills Report 2024, Accessed February 27, 2025. \n56 Financial Express, \"Indo-German Mobility and Skill Development in Focus Amidst Government Consultations,\" Financial Express, \nOctober 20, 2024. \n57 National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), \"Specified Skilled Worker.\" Accessed February 27, 2025. \n58 European Central Bank (ECB), \"The Implications of Ageing Populations for the Potential Growth of the Euro Area,\" ECB Economic Bulletin, \nIssue 4, 2021.

These \ndemographic shifts result in a lower human capital pool \nand reduced labour productivity, undermining the \nprospects of long-term economic resilience. While \nautomation and AI offer complementary solutions, they \nstill serve as a piecemeal approach to addressing the \nnuanced challenges posed by ageing societies. These \ndynamics underline the urgency for global labour mobility \nwhere labour-endowed nations like India can supply \nskilled workers to labour-scarce economies, fostering \nmutual economic growth and resilience.\nIn 2024, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) engaged in \ndiscussions with India to finalise migration and mobility \nagreements, focusing on the welfare of Indian workers \nand enhancing consular cooperation. Streamlining visa \nprocesses and promoting greater people-to-people \nexchanges have been highlighted as critical imperatives \nto leverage India's capacity to meet the demands of \nevolving economic sectors.59 Similarly, Australia and \nIndia co-signed the Migration and Mobility Partnership \nArrangement (MMPA) in May 2023, which includes the \nMobility Arrangement for Talented Early-professionals \nScheme (MATES). This scheme facilitates the mobility of \ngraduates and early-career professionals, particularly in \nsectors like renewable energy, mining, engineering and \ninformation technology, highlighting India's role in \nsupplying skilled talent for Australia's digital and \ngreen economies.60 \nWith a 20%increase in migrating Indian workers over the \npast five years, the Indian government is developing a \nNational Migration Policy to protect the rights of these \nworkers, streamline their mobility and ensuring access to \nwelfare resources.61 The Union Budget 2024 prioritised \nskilling, education, financial support, infrastructure \ndevelopment and health services with an aim to create a \nworkforce that is not only large but also highly skilled, \nproductive and capable of meeting global standards. As \nthe only country where the workforce supply is growing \nfaster than the demand, India is a hub for organisations \nwhich are seeking trained professionals and for \nprofessionals who are seeking dynamic career \nopportunities. The opportunity is particularly ripe in \nlabour-intensive industries and sectors like technology \nand healthcare where India’s workforce demonstrates \nremarkable skill readiness. Developed countries benefit \nfrom cost efficiencies and economies of scale by hiring \nIndian labour at relatively lower costs, even after \naccounting for relocation expenses, while India gains \nfrom remittances, lower unemployment rates and \nenhanced human capital.\nHowever, as India continues to deal with the imperative \nfor creating jobs, especially for the youth, it is also \nprompting the government to view employment-based \nmigration as a strategic pathway to reduce domestic \nunemployment while aligning with global labour \ndemands. This dual approach can address skill \nmismatches within the country and also ensure that \nIndia's growing workforce contributes effectively to \nglobal markets.\nRecent trends reveal a shift in the preferences of Indian \nworkers seeking opportunities abroad. The UAE is no \nlonger the top destination, with Australia, the US, \nCanada, Germany, and the UK emerging as favoured \nchoices. Additionally, countries like the Netherlands and \nNew Zealand are gaining favour due to inclusive \nimmigration policies, flexible work visas and abundant \ncareer progression opportunities.62 \nHowever, challenges related to workforce mobility \npersist. Systems supporting labour mobility often fall \nshort of achieving their intended outcomes due to \nnegative public perceptions, anti-immigrant sentiments \nand restrictive immigration policies in many high-income \ncountries. Cultural issues, complex immigration \nprocesses, and inadequate social protection or support \nsystems exacerbate the situation. The COVID-19 \npandemic further impacted migrant workers, particularly \nthose in low-skilled jobs, leading to job losses and \nfinancial distress. \n59 Shashank Singh, \"India-UAE Progress on Migration Agreements and Mobility Pacts,\" VisaVerge, May 18, 2024. \n60 Australian Government Department of Home Affairs, \"Australia and India Become Closer Mates under New Mobility Arrangement.\" Accessed \nFebruary 27, 2025. \n61 Wheebox, India Skills Report 2024.

A lack of robust domestic frameworks that can \nefficiently manage outbound migration often results in \nunregulated intermediaries exploiting aspiring workers. \nAdditionally, the uneven distribution of skilling \nprogrammes across states creates disparities in \nemployability, with rural and marginalised communities \nfacing limited access to these opportunities. Despite \nefforts to improve language training and cultural \nadaptation programmes, these initiatives often remain \nunderfunded and poorly implemented. Furthermore, \ninadequate tracking mechanisms for Indian workers \nabroad hinder the ability to address grievances and \nensure their welfare, leaving many migrant workers \nvulnerable to exploitation and unsafe working \nconditions.64 \nDemographic theory, particularly dependency ratio, \nillustrates the growing challenges advanced economies \nface due to ageing populations. By 2050, the working-\nage population in many high-income countries is \nexpected to shrink by over 92 million, while the elderly \npopulation (65 and older) will grow by more than \n100 million.65 This imbalance strains public finances, \nsocial security and healthcare systems, creating an \nurgent demand for over 400 million new workers in the \nnext 30 years.66 India’s alignment of its labour supply \nwith the needs of these economies can address this \ncrisis, fostering mutual economic growth.\nTable 3: Countries with the highest share of \npopulation (aged 65 years or older) by 2050\nCountry\nEstimated population percentage \n(65 years or above) in 2050\nHong Kong\n40.6\nSouth Korea\n39.4\nJapan\n37.5\nItaly\n37.1\nSpain\n36.6\nTaiwan\n35.3\nGreece\n34.5\nPortugal\n34.3\nOver the past decade, India has become a preferred \nhub for hiring skilled workers, with annual growth rates \nvarying between 15 to 20%, primarily driven by ageing \npopulations in developed countries. With a relatively \nyoung population (median age of 28.4 years), India has \na competitive advantage in workforce availability \nsupported by its youthful demography, which also \npresents significant consumption potential.67 India’s \nworking-age population (below 35 years) is projected to \ngrow from 62%to 68% by 2036, further strengthening its \nlabour force.68 The Global Skill Gap study by the \nNational Skill Development Corporation has highlighted \nthat there is an increased demand for talented workforce \nfrom India across IT, construction, healthcare, data \nanalytics, engineering, and hospitality sectors. \nThe Indian International Skilling Centre (IISC) Network \nis pivotal in addressing this demand, aiming to place \n1,00,000 skilled Indian candidates overseas, training \n2,50,000 through pre-departure orientation and certifying \n25,000 workers through prior learning assessments.69 \nFigure 12: Age distribution of India’s population \n(in percentage)\nSource: International Labour Organization, India Employment Report \n2024: Youth Employment, Education, and Skills.

This approach, while \nuseful, often failed to explain disparities in labour \nproductivity across regions or sectors. The concept of \nhuman capital emerged as a corrective measure, \nrecognising that workforce quality – encompassing \neducation, skills, and health – plays a crucial role in \naugmenting the productivity of labour. For example, \nworkers with higher educational attainment or \nspecialised training contribute more effectively to \neconomic output than those with limited skills, even \nwhen working similar hours.\nHuman capital is, therefore, distinct from labour. While \nlabour refers to the total hours worked, human capital \nreflects the quality of those hours, shaped by factors \nsuch as schooling, vocational training and healthcare. \nConceptually, human capital is akin to a stock variable, \nsimilar to physical capital, representing the cumulative \ninvestments in people over time. This aligns with UN’s \nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1–5 and 8, \nwhich underscore the need for equity, efficiency and \nsustainability in workforce development.72 \nInvesting in human capital addresses critical challenges \nsuch as poverty, unemployment and hunger while \nfostering sustainable economic growth. For instance, \nenhanced skilling and education reduces reliance on \nnatural ecosystems for livelihoods, especially in rural \nareas, thereby supporting environmental conservation.73 \nThis dynamic is evident in parts of the Global South, \nwhere overdependence on natural ecosystems has \nstrained resources and impeded development. By \nequipping workers with skills and knowledge, human \ncapital development reduces ecosystem dependency, \ncontributing to environmental sustainability and \nresilience.\nMeasuring human capital and its impact requires robust \ndata and nuanced approaches. While indicators like \nschool enrolment rates and average years of schooling \noffer insights, more sophisticated methods such as the \ncost approach (valuing investments in education and \nhealth) or the income approach (estimating returns on \nthese investments) are essential to gauge human \ncapital's contribution to economic growth. According to \nthe UNEP Inclusive Wealth Report 2023, human capital \nconstitutes the largest share of inclusive wealth globally \ndespite its slower growth compared to physical capital.74 \nNotably, low-income economies have recorded \nsignificant gains in human capital due to population \ngrowth and educational improvements, while high-\nincome countries continue to dominate in absolute terms.\nLabour mobility presents a pathway to enhance global \nequity and productivity. Projections indicate that low-\nincome countries will have two billion new working-age \nindividuals by 2050. Connecting such workers with \nemployers in advanced economies can significantly boost \nincomes and help in alleviating poverty as workers can \nexpect salary increases of 6 to 15 times.70 For India as \nwell as for other countries to leverage this potential, \nimproving the quality of its labour force to meet global \nstandards is imperative where country partnerships can \naddress this issue. \nAchieving workforce readiness to meet global standards \ninvolves enhancing skills and simultaneously addressing \neducational quality, healthcare access and language \nproficiency to prepare workers for competitive \ninternational markets. Despite the immense potential, \nIndia's workforce faces significant challenges to fully \ncapitalise on this demographic advantage, including \ninadequate vocational training infrastructure, mismatches \nbetween education outcomes and industry needs, low \nfemale workforce participation and regulatory hurdles for \noverseas employment.71 \nCountries like South Korea and Singapore are examples \nof how countries can efficiently harness their \ndemographic dividends since by investing in universal \neducation, promoting a culture of lifelong learning and \naligning policies with global economic demands, these \nnations have transformed their youthful populations into \nhighly productive workforces which have sustained high \nrates of economic growth. India can draw lessons from \nthese success stories while addressing its own unique \nchallenges. By aligning workforce development strategies \nwith global needs, Indian and other countries with \npotential demographic dividends can be channelled by \nlabour deficit countries which can play a transformative \nrole in shaping the future of the international labour \nmarket, driving mutual economic benefits for both the \nsource and the destination countries.\n5.2. Integrating human capital with labour \nproductivity – leveraging India's \ndemographic dividend\nIndia's demographic advantage can only be fully realised \nby enhancing the productivity of its workforce through \ninvestments in human capital. Human capital refers to the \naccumulated skills, knowledge and health of a workforce, \nwhich collectively determines its productivity and \npotential economic contributions. Unlike traditional \nmeasures of labour productivity which focus solely on the \nnumber of hours worked or output per worker, human \ncapital integrates qualitative dimensions, such as \neducation, skill development and health to assess a \nworkforce's capacity.\n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n28\n75 Shoba Suri. \"Improving India's Human Capital by Enhancing Investment in the Early Years of Children's Development.\" ORF Expert Speak, June \n26, 2021. \n76 PwC, \"One in four workers looking for new jobs as cost of living concerns bite: PwC Global Workforce Hopes & Fears Survey,\" Press Release, \nJune 20, 2023. \n77 Nilanjan Ghosh, “The value of human capital,” ORF Expert Speak, July 10, 2024. \n78 World Economic Forum, “Section 2: Human Capital” in Global Competitiveness Report Special Edition 2020: How Countries are Performing on the \nRoad to Recovery, December 16, 2020. \n79 World Economic Forum, \"From Classroom to Career: Building a Future-Ready Global Workforce,\" World Economic Forum, December 2024. \nAccording to UNEP’s Inclusive Wealth Report 2023, \nhuman capital accounted for the largest share of \ninclusive wealth globally between 1990 and 2019, \ndespite slower growth compared to physical or \nproduced capital.77 Low-income economies have \nrecorded the most significant relative increases in human \ncapital, driven by population growth and educational \nimprovements. However, high-income countries still hold \nthe largest absolute share of human capital within their \ninclusive wealth, highlighting its critical role in overall \neconomic resilience. The COVID-19 pandemic \nunderscored the need for active labour market policies \nintegrating education, health, and mid-career training \nwith broader workforce management strategies. \nHowever, similar to globalisation, technological \nadvancements and demographic shifts, workforce \nmigration has also emerged as an important factor for \nshaping global job markets. A comprehensive \nunderstanding of a country’s human capital stock is \nessential for effective policy-making and workforce \ntransition management. However, a persistent talent gap \nexists between developed and developing economies \ndue to outdated education systems. A report from World \nEconomic Forum notes that secondary education \nsystems meet employment needs at rates of 59% in \nadvanced economies and 42% in emerging economies. \nFor tertiary education, the rates are 68% in advanced \neconomies and 55% in emerging economies.78 \nIn addition to education, factors such as inadequate \nresources, limited migration networks and insufficient \naccess to technology also contribute significantly to the \nglobal talent gap. Even in developed countries, \ndisparities in skill acquisition persist due to regional \ninequalities and socio-economic barriers. For instance, a \nreport from the World Economic Forum highlights that \naccess to quality training programmes and digital \ninfrastructure often remains uneven, impeding inclusive \nworkforce development.79 Addressing these multifaceted \nchallenges requires a holistic approach beyond \neducation, including equitable resource allocation and \nimproved labour mobility networks.\n5.4. Replicable public and private sector \nintervention models for workforce \nmobility in India\nWorkforce mobility has become a global priority as \nnations grapple with demographic transitions, skill \nshortages and evolving job markets. Advanced \neconomies like Germany, Japan and Canada are \nimplementing robust migration policies to attract skilled \ntalent, addressing their ageing populations and \nlabour deficits. \nThe Indian government's strategic focus on human \ncapital development is evident in policies prioritising \neducation, healthcare and skill enhancement. Initiatives \nlike the Ayushman Bharat Yojana and the National \nEducation Policy aim to improve workforce health and \neducation, while programmes such as Skill India \nInternational Centres ensure global competitiveness. \nThese investments enhance individual well-being and \nstrengthen the nation's economic resilience against \nsystemic shocks.\nIndia ranks 116th among 174 countries in the Human \nCapital Index 2020, with a score of 0.49, up from 0.44 in \n2018. The disparity between urban and rural education is \nstark, with 57.5% of urban residents completing \nsecondary education compared to 30.6% in rural areas. \nSimilarly, higher education completion rates stand at \n21.7% in urban areas versus 5.7% in rural areas.75 While \nIndia performs better than the global average on the \ngender inequality index, health and education \nexpenditure gaps persist.\nIn a rapidly changing global economy, aligning human \ncapital development with labour market demands is \nparamount. By bridging gaps in education, skills and \nhealth, India has the potential to transform its youthful \ndemographic into a globally competitive workforce.\n5.3. Bridging the global talent gap\nThe global workforce is a mix of workers with strong \neducational qualifications, valuable skill sets and a \ncommitment to lifelong learning along with people who \ndo not meet the criteria. In the context of rapid \ntechnological change and the rise of AI-driven industries, \nskilled workers are financially more secure and \nadaptable. Workers without such skills, however, face \ngreater financial insecurity and barriers to accessing \ntraining for upskilling.\nThe PWC Global Hopes and Fear Survey 2023 reveals \nthat nearly two-thirds of workers trust their employers to \nhelp them develop digital, analytical and collaborative \nskills. However, this confidence is significantly lower \namong workers whose jobs do not currently demand \nspecialised training. Workforce mobility, often \ncharacterised by frequent employer transitions, creates a \ndual challenge for organisations – while skilled \nemployees may leverage training to secure better \nopportunities elsewhere, companies investing in human \ncapital development may struggle to retain employees \nlong enough to realise productivity gains.76 \n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n29\nCountry\nInitiative\nKey details\nImpact\nAustralia\nMoU for \nCooperation in \nVocational \nEducation and \nTraining (2020)\nIncludes the Australia-India Education Skill Council \n(AISEC), Joint Working Group and Mechanism for \nMutual Recognition of Qualifications.

Similarly, the National Education Policy \naims to transform the education system by integrating \nvocational training and emphasising skill-based learning. \nThe Atmanirbhar Bharat Yojana promotes self-reliance \nby incentivising innovation and entrepreneurship, while \nSamagra Shiksha seeks to strengthen school education \ninfrastructure and delivery.\nAdditionally, the Urban Learning Internship \nProgramme offers hands-on experience to young \nprofessionals, bridging the gap between academic \nlearning and workforce demands. These initiatives aim to \naddress disparities in human capital development by \nenhancing access to education, training and healthcare, \nparticularly in rural and underserved areas. By ensuring \ntransparency and accountability in their implementation, \nthe government seeks to maximise the effectiveness of \nthese programmes.\nThe global workforce landscape is evolving, with workers \ndemanding higher wages and greater meaning from their \nwork. This has renewed emphasis on skill-first hiring \napproaches to address labour shortages. By quantifying \nthe value of skill development initiatives, firms can justify \ntraining expenditures relative to workers’ productivity and \nwage growth. Integrating career progression plans with \nhuman capital investments can mitigate turnover rates, \nincentivise productivity and foster a sustainable \nworkforce. Such strategies are essential for optimising \ntalent in highly mobile labour markets.\nAs technological, demographic and economic \ntransformations accelerate, the need for a globally \ncompetitive workforce has never been greater. By \naligning education and skill development with labour \nmarket demands, nations can bridge talent gaps and \nfoster inclusive growth. For India, the focus must remain \non leveraging its demographic dividend through \nsustained investments in human capital. This approach \nwill enable India to navigate workforce transitions \neffectively, ensuring sustainable economic growth and \nresilience in a rapidly changing global environment.\nEnriching human capital resources involves increasing \nthe number of skilled workers and ensuring that their \nproductivity aligns with global standards. Achieving this \nrequires a strategic focus on education, skill \ndevelopment, health and overall well-being. \nIn many countries, functional constraints such as \ninformation asymmetries, coordination failures among \nindustry stakeholders, financial pressures and negative \nexternalities hinder the effectiveness of skill-based \necosystems. Governments play a pivotal role as \nfacilitators, guiding these ecosystems to align with \nanticipated outcomes. By becoming proactive \norchestrators, governments can ensure worker \nprotection and economic growth. Critical interventions \ninclude building comprehensive digital skill platforms to \naddress information asymmetry, sustaining skilling \ninvestments through policy measures like tax exemptions \nor paid education leaves, and strengthening bilateral \nagreements to safeguard migrant workers’ rights, wages \nand working conditions.\n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n31\nTable 5: Government of India’s initiatives for enhancing workforce mobility\nYear of \nimplementation\nExisting \nprogrammes\nObjective\nImpact on global workforce \nmobility\n2015\nGlobal Initiative of \nAcademic Networks \n(GIAN)\nTapping the talent pool of \nscientists and entrepreneurs \ninternationally to encourage \nengagement with higher \ninstitutions in India.\nPartnerships with foreign \ncountries, particularly the EU and \nChina, alongside Indian IITs, NITs, \nand IISERs, have made Indian \nstudents more attractive in global \njob markets.\n2018\nPre-departure \nOrientation Training \n(PDOT)\nPreparing migrant workers for \ndestination countries' cultural, \nlinguistic and regulatory \nchallenges.\nBegan with four centres and \nexpanded to 41 across India, \noffering free 8-hour training \nmodules.

Recent labour market analyses underscore an \nopportunity for India to align its workforce capabilities \nwith global demand, filling sector-specific skill shortages \nin the healthcare, IT and construction industries.\nAchieving this alignment requires addressing both \nsupply-side factors such as education and training, and \ndemand-side factors such as sectoral deficiencies and \nmigration policies. A combined effort by governments \nand the private sector can ensure that India’s labour \nsurplus is effectively leveraged to meet global workforce \nneeds. Strengthening these partnerships will help build a \nresilient, interconnected economy while reinforcing \nIndia’s position as a critical contributor to the \nglobal workforce.\n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n32\nGlobal workforce mobility extends beyond just the forces \nof international labour markets facilitating migration \npatterns across regions. It encompasses the organised \nmovement of human capital across international borders \nto fill skill and labour shortages in host nations, leading to \nrelative wage share equalisation across borders.81 \nThe interaction of pureplay labour economics with \ninternational relations underpins such mobility which is \nessential for sustainable global economic growth, \nespecially in an interconnected world where demographic \ndisparities are becoming increasingly apparent. \nIndia, among other countries with younger populations, \nwith a significant increase in its labour force from \n396.3 million in 2000 to 567.4 million in 2022 and a \nrelative increase in its workforce, has a ready supply of \nindividuals seeking better employment opportunities.82 \nWhen facilitated strategically, this surplus can meet the \ndemand generated by advanced economies experiencing \nworker shortages. Advanced economies’ structural \nrigidities and protectionist policies, however, complicate \nthis simple supply-demand match. Thus, countries with \nyounger populations must approach workforce mobility \nthoughtfully, exploring diversified models that address \nspecific sectoral and national needs while respecting \nimmigration constraints, skill requirements and local \ncultural factors. \n06\nModels of workforce mobility\nHaving discussed the significant demographic \nopportunity of India’s workforce, its abundant labour \nsupply and prospects to capitalise upon it, this chapter \ndelves deeper into exploring the institutional \narrangements which will be necessary to navigate the \nsupply and demand dynamics of international labour \nmarkets towards an equilibrium, including the criteria for \ndefining the target sectors for such workers in the \ndestination countries and the global workforce mobility \nframeworks that can facilitate smooth workforce \nmigration, integration and reintegration (if needed) to \nmaximise the economic benefits for both countries as \nwell as the social well-being of the workers.\n81 According to the Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) model of international trade, countries export resources (in this case, labour) they have in abundance and \nimport the resources less abundant to benefit from their comparative advantage.

Global hotspots for workforce mobility\nAt the outset, drawing upon discussions in the previous sections, the criteria for selecting global hotspots for workforce \nmobility necessitates identifying countries and sectors where job opportunities are concentrated, labour demand is \nabundant relative to its supply and policy environments are amenable to immigration. In categorical terms, the criteria for \nglobal hotspots, therefore, include the following:\nCountries with multicultural societies are generally more receptive to foreign \nworkers, promoting inclusivity in a socially cohesive environment. For \nexample, Germany’s plan to expand language courses both in India and for \nworkers who are already there shows potential and intent towards attracting \nmore workers from India to address its labour scarcity.86 On the other hand, \nnations with strong anti-immigration sentiment may prefer alternative \nmodels, such as off-shore conclaves. At this time, easy regulatory policies, \nopen immigration frameworks and support for international workers play a \nkey role in facilitating a smooth transition. \nCultural and political receptiveness\nCountries with liberal immigration policies and those confronting the \npressures of relatively dependent demography are more likely to facilitate \nphysical workforce mobility. A research conducted by OECD highlights \nnations like Canada and Germany, which have introduced policies to \nstreamline skilled immigration, as prime hotspots for mobility.85 \nUnderstanding visa requirements, employment restrictions and recognition \nof foreign qualifications is essential for maximising workforce integration. \nFor example, the strict language proficiency requirements for immigrants in \ncountries like France and Japan and the limited multicultural support \ninfrastructure have acted as significant barriers to the economic integration \nof foreign workers in these countries.\nRegulatory environment\nCountries like Japan, Germany and Canada exhibit high demand in \nhealthcare, skilled trades and technology sectors, influenced by high \ndependency ratios and a rapidly ageing population. Identifying these \nsectors allows India to target mobility programmes which are aligned with \nthe workforce demands across skill levels in these host countries. For \ninstance, as of 2023, almost 75% of US companies outsourced IT services \nto India. This resulted in significant revenue growth for these companies \nand made the US more competitive globally.83 Similarly, in 2023, blue-collar \nmigration from India to the Middle East saw a 50% growth over the previous \nyear, with the UAE’s demand for skilled and non-skilled workers in sectors \nlike construction, manufacturing and logistics witnessing a 25% and 15% \nrise, respectively.84 \nLabour demand in key sectors\n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n34\nIndia’s strategy in workforce mobility must consider these \nassimilation dynamics, focusing on supporting its \nworkers through culturally adaptive training, legal \nassistance for navigating employment rights and \nlanguage programmes to facilitate communication and \nworkplace harmony in host nations. \nHowever, assimilation and integration of foreign workers \noften confront challenges of their own, highlighting the \npotential for other diverse institutional arrangements \nsuch as off-shore conclaves or the guest workers model, \nthat can facilitate the Indian workforce emerging as a \nglobal public good.\n6.2.1. Model 1: On-shore jobs\nThe ‘on-shore jobs’ model envisions that Indian workers \ncan directly be assimilated into host countries' labour \nmarkets, contributing to their economies as resident \nemployees. This model is one of the most \nstraightforward workforce mobility arrangements, \nparticularly suited to economies confronting demographic \nchallenges and actively seeking to mitigate associated \nrisks by facilitating workers' immigration into their \neconomies. The on-shore model aligns with several \nlabour mobility theories, notably the Harris-Todaro \nmodel, which posits that the expectation of higher wages \nand employment opportunities primarily drives rural-to-\nurban migration.90 When applied to international \nmigration, this model suggests that Indian workers are \nlikely to migrate to countries offering higher salaries and \nbetter living standards, provided these countries have \nadequate job openings in specific sectors. The wage \ndifferential incentivises mobility, benefiting workers and \nthe host country.\nAdditionally, the dual labour market theory91 separates \nthe labour market into primary and secondary sectors to \nprovide further insight. Primary sectors in advanced \neconomies – characterised by well-paying, stable jobs \nwith career growth opportunities – are increasingly \ndifficult to fill due to shrinking native workforces. Indian \nworkers can fulfil this demand, especially in healthcare, \nIT and engineering, allowing these sectors to remain \ncompetitive globally. This model is, therefore, particularly \nsuitable for several high-demand sectors where \nworkforce deficits are relatively pronounced – India’s \nrobust education system and growing emphasis on \nupskilling position it as a global talent hub. For instance, \nthe National Skill Development Mission in India aims to \nskill over 400 million individuals by 2025, making Indian \nworkers particularly suitable for global markets.\n87 International Organization for Migration (IOM), Global compact for \nsafe, orderly and regular migration, Geneva: IOM, 2024. Accessed \nFebruary 27, 2025. \n88 Gordon’s Theory of Assimilation posits that immigrant groups \nundergo a multi-stage process of assimilation into the host society, \nprogressing through stages such as acculturation, structural \nintegration, intermarriage, identification and civic assimilation, but not \nnecessarily in a linear or complete manner.\n89 Milton M. Gordon. \"Assimilation in America: Theory and Reality.\" \nDaedalus, Vol. 90, No. 2, Ethnic Groups in American Life (Spring, \n1961), pp. 263-285 (23 pages), 1961. \n90 John R. Harris and Michael P.

Workforce mobility frameworks and \napproaches\nIdentification of global hotspots is, therefore, crucial for \nformulating an effective workforce mobility strategy for \nIndia and other countries with younger populations. Such \nstrategies can take the form of bilateral agreements \nwhich often create specific and mutually beneficial terms \ntailored to the needs of the partnering countries, or \nmultilateral frameworks, which may involve multiple \ncountries within a region. Each approach offers unique \nadvantages and necessitates specific arrangements \namong partner countries. While bilateral agreements \nprovide flexibility, focus on particular sectors and allow \nfor streamlined processes, such as faster recognition of \nqualifications and targeted visa types, which ease \nworkers’ transition into the host country’s workforce, \nmultilateral models, though more complex to negotiate, \noffer scalability and can cover broader regions, allowing \nIndian workers access to several countries \nsimultaneously. For instance, India’s agreements with \nGermany address specific skill requirements in \nhealthcare and technology. In contrast, the Global \nCompact for Migration,87 a UN initiative, promotes safe, \norderly and regular migration pathways, which could \nprovide a framework for regional agreements where \nlabour can be integrated into Europe or other \ncollaborative regions. \nBeyond the specifics of immigration agreements, \nsuccessful workforce mobility depends on the \nframeworks underpinning these institutional \narrangements that can ensure ease of migration and the \nassimilation and adaptability of workers in the host \nnation. Economic and sociological theories have \nextensively provided insights into this process. For \nexample, Gordon’s Theory of Assimilation88 highlights \nthe gradual integration of immigrants through stages \nbeginning with economic integration, followed by social \nand cultural assimilation.89 When foreign workers are \nboth economically and socially accepted into host \nnations for on-shore jobs, they become more productive \ncontributors to society.\nEconomic models of assimilation also point to the \nimportance of wage convergence, where foreign workers’ \nwages eventually align with those of native workers in \nsimilar roles, indicating full integration. For workers, \nachieving wage parity and career progression in host \nnations enhances their economic contribution while \nraising the overall productivity of the workforce. \n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n35\n92 Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India, Agreement between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the Federal \nRepublic of Germany on a Comprehensive Migration and Mobility Partnership.

Many skilled workers face \nchallenges when their qualifications are not recognised \nabroad. India’s strategic agreements should advocate for \nstreamlined certification processes and recognition of \ncredentials in sectors like healthcare and IT, making it \neasier for skilled professionals to practise abroad. It is \nalso essential to ensure Indian workers can access social \nbenefits such as healthcare, pensions and housing. \nPartnerships which guarantee equal treatment for foreign \nworkers mitigate potential discrimination issues and \nensure a more stable, committed workforce. \nBut, most importantly, successful workforce integration \nrequires pre-departure training and skill alignment to \nmeet host-country standards. India could implement or \nre-envision its targeted training programmes tailored to \nthe requirements of specific countries, easing the \ntransition and ensuring productivity from day one.\nWorkers may also face cultural or language barriers, \naffecting productivity and social integration. Host nations \nand Indian agencies can collaborate on cultural and \nlanguage training to ease this transition. Bilateral \nagreements can also be crucial in addressing credential \nrecognition issues and ensuring social protection for \nIndian workers. Streamlined certification processes, \nnegotiated through these agreements, can help workers \ngain quicker access to their professions abroad. \n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n36\n95 Gashawbeza W.

Since immigration is a sensitive issue in \nmany countries, public opinion can influence policy. \nTherefore, supplier country’s approach should involve \ndiplomatic engagement, emphasising the economic \ncontributions and social benefits of Indian workers to \nlocal communities. Additionally, reliance on a foreign \nworkforce may expose host economies to vulnerabilities, \nespecially if immigration policies shift. Through bilateral \nor multilateral arrangements, diversified workforce \nagreements can reduce dependence on a single source \nand encourage stable mobility. Surrounded by many \nopportunities, the operationalisation of the ‘on-shore jobs’ \nmodel also necessitates that all supplier countries like \nIndia strike a delicate balance between the various \nframeworks for workforce mobility.\n6.2.2. Model 2: Off-shore conclaves\nThe ‘Off-shore conclaves’ model represents a relatively \nnovel approach to workforce mobility designed for \ncountries facing demographic challenges but with strong \nreservations about permanent immigration or cultural \nintegration of foreign workers. In this model, specialised \nworking communities or conclaves are established within \nthe host country, but they operate semi-autonomously, \noften with restricted integration into the broader host \nsociety. These conclaves allow workers to contribute to \nhost economies while addressing potential security, \ncultural or political concerns around immigration. The off-\nshore conclaves model requires rigorous planning, \ncooperation and carefully structured agreements. Still, it \nhas the potential to serve as a flexible and scalable \nworkforce mobility solution in regions with unique political \nor cultural constraints.\nThis model variant draws from the theories of economic \ngeography and industrial clustering,95 where clusters or \nconcentrated working environments enhance productivity \nby centralising talent, resources and infrastructure. \nInstead of integrating directly into the wider society, \nIndian workers can perform specific roles in designated \nconclaves, focusing on sectors experiencing labour \nshortages. Economic clustering of industries ensures that \nefficiencies arise from workers operating close to each \nother within sector-specific ecosystems. The ‘off-shore \nconclaves’ model also builds on the concept of \ninstitutional enclaves, often seen in free-trade zones, \nexport processing zones, or tech hubs, where policies \nand regulations differ from those governing the \nsurrounding society. Off-shore conclaves create \nenvironments where both host and sending nations can \naddress specific labour needs without conflicting with \nbroader immigration policies, creating a targeted solution \nthat aligns with the host’s strategic interests. Specific \nindustries, particularly those with strict operational \nprotocols and high levels of security, align well with the \noff-shore conclave model. \nTarget sectors\nHost \neconomies\nOpportunity \nareas\nManufacturing\nAdvanced \neconomies \nlike Germany, \nJapan, and \nthe US\nCost-effective \nworkforce \ndeployment, \nretention of \ndomestic \nproduction \ncapabilities\nTechnology\nIT-driven \nnations like \nIreland, \nSingapore \nand South \nKorea\nLocalised project \nexecution, \ncompliance with \ndata security \nneeds\nConstruction\nGulf nations \nand \ninfrastructure-\nfocused \neconomies\nExecution of high-\nvalue \ninfrastructure \nprojects with \ntargeted Indian \nexpertise\nLogistics and \nshipping\nPort-focused \nnations like \nthe UAE and \nSingapore\nOptimisation of \nport operations \nand logistics \ninfrastructure\nThough off-shore conclaves are relatively new in \nworkforce mobility, few precedents illustrate its potential. \nThe United Arab Emirates has numerous free trade \nzones (FTZs), where foreign workers are employed \nunder specific conditions and do not integrate fully into \nthe local population. Fairly non-identical to each other, \nthis setup demonstrates the operational flexibility that \noff-shore conclaves could offer, with dedicated \ninfrastructure, housing and support services for foreign \nworkers.96 Ireland has a well-developed IT hub where \nforeign workers collaborate on project-based \nassignments. Although these professionals integrate \nmore broadly than envisioned in the off-shore conclave \nmodel, clustering IT skills and resources demonstrates \nhow conclaves can streamline productivity while \npreserving localised expertise. South Korea established \n‘smart’ factory zones for skilled foreign labour in its \nindustrial sectors, demonstrating how conclaves focused \non high-demand skill sets can serve national goals \nwithout disrupting social harmony.97 The off-shore \nconclave model offers unique benefits for both host \ncountries and Indian workers. \nSource: https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/\npublic-policy/usacm/intellectual-property/reports-and-white-\npapers/full_final1.pdf; https://www.eiu.com/n/promising-outlook-for-\ngcc-construction-sector/; https://www.eiu.com/n/promising-outlook-for-\ngcc-construction-sector/. \n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n37\n98 International Labour Organization, Labour market segmentation.

The success of off-shore conclaves hinges on \nclear bilateral agreements outlining worker rights, legal \nprotections and operational guidelines. These \nagreements should specify worker residency, labour \nconditions and repatriation rights. Specialised conclaves \nwill also need streamlined licensing processes to ensure \nIndian workers’ qualifications are recognised for their \nroles. Supplier countries and the host nation must \ncollaborate to establish qualification equivalencies and \nlicensing standards, particularly in regulated fields \nlike healthcare.\nConclave infrastructure must include support services \nsuch as healthcare, housing, language programmes and \nlegal assistance to promote a stable and productive \nworking environment. India could play an active role in \nproviding these services, supported by a liaison office \nwithin the host country to address worker needs. Host \nnations can incentivise this participation by allowing \nflexible financial arrangements, including remittance \nfacilitation and possible tax exemptions. Workers in these \nconclaves would benefit from remittance mechanisms \nthat support their families back home, stimulating \neconomic gains for both countries.\nThe limited social interaction with the broader host \nsociety may affect workers in conclaves, increasing the \nscope for social isolation. To mitigate this, conclaves \ncould organise cross-cultural exchanges and localised \nsocial programmes to build connections while respecting \nthe host country’s cultural boundaries. In some countries, \nconclaves could face public opposition due to concerns \nabout isolationist practices. Public awareness campaigns \nemphasising the benefits of conclaves such as \naddressing critical labour shortages and supporting \nnational growth could help improve perceptions and ease \nlocal concerns. \nAlso, over-reliance on conclaves may challenge \nworkforce integration and adaptability in the host \neconomy, especially for industries requiring evolving skill \nsets. While the off-shore conclave model presents a \ncompelling solution for specific workforce needs in socio-\npolitically sensitive contexts, critical considerations \nregarding clear policies and targeted sectoral \napproaches have limited its adoption and scalability.\n6.2.3. Model 3: Guest worker programmes\nThe ‘Guest worker programmes’ model offers the most \nflexible and temporary arrangement where Indian \nworkers can work in the host country for a specific period \nbefore returning home. Unlike permanent or semi-\nautonomous conclave-based migration, guest worker \nprogrammes are typically geared toward filling short-to-\nmedium-term labour shortages, particularly in seasonal, \nproject-based or demand-driven sectors. The model has \nbeen successfully implemented worldwide, balancing the \nhost country's immediate economic needs with a \ntemporary integration approach that aligns with the host \nsociety’s preferences. Guest worker programmes \nrepresent a time-bound solution that minimises \npermanent settlement or cultural integration concerns. \nThe guest worker model aligns with several economic \ntheories, particularly the labour market segmentation \ntheory,98 which explains how labour markets are often \ndivided into primary and secondary segments. The \nprimary segment consists of stable, well-paid jobs \nrequiring high skill levels, often filled by native workers or \nlong-term immigrants. In contrast, the secondary \nsegment is characterised by lower wages, minimal \nbenefits and seasonal or temporary work, which native \nworkers may find less attractive. Guest worker \nprogrammes enable workers to fill these secondary \nsector jobs, helping host economies maintain productivity \nwithout a permanent influx of foreign workers. \n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n38\n99 Human Capital theory is an economic framework that views individuals’ skills, knowledge, experience and education as valuable assets that \ncontribute to their productivity and economic success. \n100 Center for Global Development.

Canada’s \nSeasonal Agricultural Worker Programme (SAWP) \nallows foreign workers from countries like Mexico and \nJamaica to work in Canada’s agriculture sector during \npeak seasons. If extended to India, this model could help \nIndian agricultural workers gain experience in advanced \nfarming techniques, contributing to skill development and \nknowledge transfer.100 Similarly, Germany has \ndeveloped temporary work permit systems for skilled \nlabour in sectors like construction and engineering. \nIndian workers are employed for specific projects, \ncontributing their expertise while benefiting from short-\nterm residency. \nExpanding such arrangements to include healthcare or \nrenewable energy sectors could address Germany’s \nlabour shortages and meet India’s economic \nobjectives.101 The US also has guest worker \nprogrammes under the H-2A and H-2B visa categories, \nwhich allow foreign workers to fill seasonal agricultural \nand non-agricultural jobs. Workers could leverage these \nprogrammes for employment in the hospitality, \nconstruction and agriculture sectors, particularly in \nregions facing acute labour shortages.102\nGuest worker programmes are particularly well-suited to \naddress the cyclical and seasonal nature of labour \ndemand in specific sectors by allowing host economies \nto scale their workforce during peak demand periods \nwithout committing to permanent immigration as these \nprogrammes ensure flexibility and cost-efficiency. For \nworkers, such arrangements offer consistent short-term \nemployment opportunities abroad, providing an \nadditional income stream and exposure to advanced \ntechniques and practices. These programmes can \ncontribute to economic sustainability for workers by \nreducing underemployment in rural and semi-skilled \nsegments, enhancing skill sets through knowledge \ntransfer, and enabling remittances that support their \nfamilies and local economies back home.\nAdditionally, the ‘human capital’ theory99 suggests that \nthe temporary nature of guest worker programmes allows \nworkers to gain skills and experience abroad that can be \nreinvested in their home country upon their return. This \nmodel provides remittance inflows for supplier countries \nand helps boost domestic human capital when skilled \nworkers bring back newly acquired knowledge and \nexperience. Guest worker programmes are most effective \nin sectors that have seasonal, cyclical or demand-driven \nlabour needs. \nTable 10: Opportunities of guest worker programmes \nfor Indian workers in target sectors\nTarget \nsectors\nHost \neconomies\nOpportunity areas\nAgriculture\nCanada, US, \nAustralia\nSeasonal roles in \nplanting, harvesting \nand packing; \nknowledge transfer of \nadvanced farming \ntechniques to India\nTourism and \nhospitality\nEurope, \nMiddle East\nSupporting peak \ndemand in \nhospitality, food \nservice, and \nentertainment \nindustrie\nConstruction \nand \nengineering\nGermany, \nUS\nShort-term \nemployment on \ninfrastructure and \nengineering projects; \nskill enhancement for \nworkers in advanced \nsystems\nSource: https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/\nreports/2023/01/labour-and-skills-shortages-in-the-agro-food-\nsector_c9915f4e/ed758aab-en.pdf;  \nhttps://www.hotrec.eu/media/static/files/import/wp_post_48505/Labour-\nshortages-in-the-hospitality-sector-.pdf; https://www.ifo.de/en/press-\nrelease/2021-10-06/shortage-skilled-workers-german-construction-\nsites-worsens \n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n39\nTable 11: Advantages of guest worker programmes \nfor workers and economies\nA successful guest worker programme hinges on \ntransparent and fair policy frameworks protecting \nworkers’ rights and host-country interests. Bilateral \nagreements between supplier and host nations should \nclarify worker rights, wages, benefits and health \ninsurance provisions. These agreements should ensure \nfair treatment, prevent exploitation and facilitate \nrepatriation processes when contracts conclude. \nCountries could utilise their pre-departure training for \nworkers to maximise productivity and minimise \nadjustment challenges for these short-term roles. \nThis orientation should include skill alignment, language \ntraining and cultural sensitivity sessions to prepare the \nworkers to meet host-country’s expectations over a \nshorter time span. Ensuring workers have access to \nadequate health and safety protections is essential \nespecially in sectors like construction and agriculture. \nRegulatory oversight in host countries and advocacy by \ncountry missions abroad can help uphold safety \nstandards and reduce workplace risks – a critical aspect \noften amiss in limited contracts.\nDue to their temporary status, guest workers remain \nvulnerable to exploitation. Strong governance and \nreporting mechanisms along with bilateral protections can \nsafeguard Indian workers’ rights, ensuring that they \nreceive fair wages and humane working conditions. \nPrimarily driven by demand, employment opportunities \nfor guest workers can vary based on economic conditions \nand programme instability can leave workers vulnerable \nto abrupt changes. Bilateral agreements should include \ncontingency plans which provide support in case of \nunexpected terminations and repatriation assistance if \nnecessary.\nDespite the challenges for each arrangement, they \npresent significant opportunities for capitalising upon the \nIndian workforce’s economic potential. However, certain \noperational practices surrounding these arrangements \nneed to be worked upon by implementing appropriate \npolicy and regulatory frameworks. Moreover, it is mostly \na cyclical journey that workers undergo as they go \nabroad, assimilate in the host countries, gain valuable \nskills, adapt to their cultural nuances, send remittances \nor eventually return to their country. Each stage in this \ncycle has its complexities. \nThe next chapter summarises the various stages of \nworkforce mobility from a lifecycle approach. \nUnderstanding this lifecycle highlights the enduring \nimpact of workforce mobility on both the home and the \nhost countries.

The \ncapacity of the country to fulfil global demand is \nunderpinned by a steady pipeline of highly skilled \nprofessionals in areas such as software engineers, \nhealthcare specialists, advanced manufacturing and \ninfrastructure development experts. Mature economies, \nsuch as Germany, Japan and Canada, seek talent to \naddress their demographic imbalances, thereby \npresenting prime pathways for Indian human capital \ndeployment in global markets. Bilateral labour \nagreements, regional frameworks and multilateral \nmobility pacts have begun to harmonise regulatory \nstandards and streamline processes, however, persistent \nbarriers remain. Therefore, there is a need to reconcile \ncross-border qualification equivalences, navigate \nevolving protectionist stances and craft policies that \nensure workers’ rights and well-being abroad.\nAccording to a survey conducted by the Global Labor \nMarket Conference,103 most workers consider \ntechnological change to be the greatest disruptor of \nlabour markets. In the dynamic global landscape, where \ntechnology is infused in every task, workers have to \nacquire skills that cater to technology-heavy jobs. Thus, it \nis evident that the migration of workers from countries \nlike India must involve skilled-labour. However, skilled \nlabour usually has the bandwidth to access jobs across \nboundaries. Given the rate of technological change, they \nare also in greater demand.To enhance the rate of \nworkforce migration from countries including India, the \nlow- to medium-skilled workers need to be prepared for \ninternational jobs. Before delving into the policy \nrequirements to facilitate such movement, we look at \nlabour market data to identify which sectors actually have \nthe greatest demand. \n07\nLifecycle analysis of workforce movement\n103 S.

Job openings levels and rates by industry and region, seasonally adjusted, February 04, 2025. \nJob vacancy rate shows the proportion of new opening or \nvacancies as a proportion of all possible jobs in a sector. \nHigher job vacancy rate implies greater demand or \nshorter supply in the sector. The greatest job vacancy \nrate, was recorded in administrative and support service \nactivities. Construction, information and communication, \nprofessional, scientific and technical activities and \naccommodation and food service activities followed in \norder. Thus, it is evident that demand for workers is \nlinear across skill levels as there is a greater demand for \nhighly skilled workforce. \nAccording to a report,104 the greatest number of \nvacancies in the US are in the professional and business \nservices sectors, i.e. the highly educated workers at the \ntop percentiles of skill level. Private education and health \nservices follows with other sectors like hospitality, trade \nand transportation portraying similar demand. Similarly in \nthe UK, as of November 2024, human health and social \nactivities have the most vacancies. It is followed by \nhospitality, retail and trade. Thus, broader trends across \ndeveloping countries showcase the demand for skilled \nworkers. Moreover, the demand for professionals in \nfinance, healthcare and hospitality is exponential. \nThe next section delves into how governments can \ndesign policies to catalyse a country’s workforce into a \nglobal one through directed focus on key sectors. \n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n41\nTo maximise the dividends of these transnational labour flows, countries must refine their approach by analysing market \nrequirements through data analytics, bolstering technical and soft skills training, and reinforcing institutional capacities \nthat support ethical recruitment, equitable wage standards, and conducive work environments. It is also essential to \nsupport the human dimension by supporting workers and their families through pre-departure orientation, mentorship \nschemes, and post-assignment reintegration programmes that acknowledge personal growth trajectories and \ncultural transitions.\n7.2 Demand generation\nDue to a global scarcity in talent as well as a dynamic shift in skill \nrequirements, governments can pursue a multidimensional \napproach in order to generate global demand for domestic talent. \nGovernments can have high preference towards regional as well as \nbilateral labour schemes which promote global labour mobility along \nwith establishing associations with developed which have a \ndemographic and skills shortfall which can be overcome with a \nsecure, preferred migration corridor. Such arrangements can \nfacilitate work permit formalities, ease documentation as well as \nfacilitate smoother identification overseas.\nThe role of technology, more specifically that of \nAI, will have to be addressed in a labour welfare \npolicy. Some early steps can be in terms of \nopening specialised training institutes and skill \ndevelopment centres in high-priority industries. \nLow-skilled as well as medium-skilled labour can \nbe upskilled with short-duration certificates, digital \nliteracy and sectoral course training in line with \nglobal sectoral demands. These can greatly boost \nemployability abroad.\nOne of the largest \nchallenges which workers \nface is the absence of \nstandard training and \nqualifications. India aims to \nimprove this with the New \nEducation Policy. However, \ngovernment co-operation \nwith global bodies which \naccredit qualifications, as \nwell as investments in \nculture-based professional \ndevelopment and language \ntraining will be necessary to \nachieve standardisation.\nBy focusing on sectors with \nhigh vacancy rates like \nadministrative support, \nconstruction, ICT, healthcare \nand hospitality, Indian \npolicymakers can channel \ntalent into disciplines most \nsought after internationally. \nThis means working closely \nwith industry stakeholders, \nboth at home and abroad, to \nforecast demand, identify skill \ngaps, and fine-tune \ncurriculum, thus creating \nsteady pipelines of well-\ntrained professionals ready to \nmeet global market needs.\nThe government can also launch global awareness \ncampaigns by participating in international job fairs, \ncollaborating with overseas chambers of commerce \nand leveraging diplomatic missions to showcase the \nquality, adaptability and cultural fluency of Indian \nworkers. Emphasising India’s track record in ICT, \nhealthcare and professional services can position its \nworkforce as a premium choice, thus raising overall \nglobal demand. By following a mix of these strategies, \ngovernments in supplier countries can systematically \nshape their workforce into a globally recognized talent \npool, fostering both individual economic opportunities \nand enhanced national competitiveness in an \nincreasingly interconnected labour market.\n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n42\n7.3 India model – learnings to emulate for \nother supplier countries\n7.3.1 Skill upgradation: Bridging the gap to meet \nglobal standards\nIndia has emerged as a leading international supplier of \nskilled workers, leveraging its demographic dividend with \nsystematic skill formation and mobility programmes. \nInitiatives such as National Skill Development Mission \n(NSDM) and Skill India, and international skilling \ncollaborations have enhanced training quality, \nstrengthened alignment with labour markets and \nfacilitated migration pathways. India's global capability \ncentres (GCCs) and strategic partnerships with \ndestination countries indicate its increasingly significant \nrole in the international economy. Nevertheless, there are \nlimitations related to unequal geographic coverage, \nindustry-specific training gaps and barriers to returnee \nprofessional integration. By addressing such limitations \nand enhancing its skilling and migration systems, India \ncan establish itself as an important player in exportable \nworkforce and reap significant economic benefits. \nIndia has taken significant steps to address inconsistent \ntraining quality and governance bottlenecks in its skill \ndevelopment ecosystem. The National Skill Development \nMission (NSDM), launched in 2015, provides a cohesive \nframework to strengthen institutional mechanisms and \nenhance training reach and quality while the Skill \nStrengthening for Industrial Value Enhancement \n(STRIVE) initiative, introduced in 2017 with World Bank, \nfocuses on improving the efficiency and market relevance \nof vocational training through modernised infrastructure \nand industry partnerships. \nThe Skill Acquisition and Knowledge Awareness for \nLivelihood Promotion (SANKALP) programme, also \ninitiated in 2016, aims to resolve governance challenges \nby building robust district-level training structures and \nensuring inclusivity in skill development. Additionally, the \nNational Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), \nestablished in 2009, has streamlined private sector \nparticipation in skilling, improving quality assurance and \nfostering innovation. These initiatives collectively try to \naddress the systemic challenges, demonstrating India's \ncommitment to building a globally competitive workforce.\nSignificant progress has been made over the last \ndecade, ensuring that Indian workers seamlessly \nintegrate into international labour markets, equipping \nthem with globally competitive skills. This means \nimproving technical competencies and addressing \ncultural, linguistic and adaptability challenges. For \nexample, India's global capability centres (GCCs) have \ntransformed from traditional back-office operations into \nhubs of strategic innovation, significantly impacting the \nglobal professional services sector. Employing nearly \n1.9 million professionals, these centres – over 1,700 \nacross India as of 2024- generate USD 64.6 billion in \nrevenue, with projections to reach USD 105 billion by \n2030.105 They now encompass high-value functions such \nas research and development, advanced analytics and \nfinance, showcasing India's skilled workforce and mature \noffshoring ecosystem. This evolution highlights India's \nrole as a leading destination for professional services, \ndriven by its vast talent pool and growing expertise in \ndelivering global business solutions. The training \necosystem in India, while expanding over the years, \noften faces infrastructure gaps, quality concerns and \nlimited alignment to industrial needs, particularly in the \nwider context of global mobility.106 Many of the remaining \nbinding constraints will need to be overcome before India \ntruly becomes a global hub for skilled labour. \nIndia’s skilling landscape still has uneven geographic \ncoverage and dated curricula which often has limited \nrelevance given the demands of Industry 4.0. Addressing \nthis requires a targeted approach, including a \ncomprehensive need-mapping exercise to identify \nskillsets in demand across 'target' countries for workforce \nexport, such as healthcare in Japan, construction in the \nGulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations, information \ntechnology in Europe and North America, and advanced \nmanufacturing in Germany.\nRural areas remain underserved, exacerbating the \nurban-rural divide in skilling outcomes. Furthermore, the \nlack of well-trained trainers undermines the effectiveness \nof existing programmes. Recognition of informal skills – a \nkey aspect for large segments of India’s workforce – \nremains minimal, leaving many workers underqualified to \nparticipate in international labour markets despite having \nsubstantial experience.107 India’s demographic challenge \ncompounds these structural challenges.

For example, collaborations with \norganisations such as the International Labour \nOrganization (ILO) or industry-specific certifying \nauthorities could enhance the global employability of \nIndian workers. Nevertheless, many initiatives across \nIndia tend to focus on entry-level skills, neglecting \nopportunities for advanced or specialised training \nrequired by global markets.108 On the demand side, a \nrecent NITI Aayog paper identifies the reluctance of the \nIndian middle-class to take up physical work, which \nadds to the complexity creating a gap in the availability \nof labour for certain sectors despite existing workforce \nsurpluses.109 \n108 Rajesh Gupta, Rajesh, and Oshin Dharap, \"How is India skilling its youth?

Baru, “Privatisation and Corporatisation,” in  Unhealthy Trends: A symposium on the state\nof our public health system, May 2000. \nFor India, this approach underlines the importance of \nencouraging initial migration and the eventual return of \nskilled workers with the potential to enrich domestic \nworkers. India’s own history also offers lessons. In the \n1980s, a wave of reverse migration of medical \nprofessionals from the Middle East and Western \ncountries promoted the rapid growth of private \nhealthcare across different parts of the country. \nEquipped with global expertise and financial capital, \nthese professionals established hospitals and \ndiagnostic centres that reformed healthcare delivery in \nIndia.112 This example which is one of the significant \ncontributors for turning India into a health tourism hub \nshows how the strategic reintegration of skilled \nprofessionals can deliver transformative change, a \nlesson that remains relevant because India wants to \ntailor its competent ecosystem to global standards.\nThe ongoing partnerships with, for example, Germany \nand Japan have led to targeted improvements in health \nand industrial skills, while language and cultural \norientation programmes are also being implemented.110 \nThese tailor-made efforts will make it easier for workers \nnot only to meet the technical standards of the \ndestination economies but also to integrate them into \ntheir new environment. In addition, AI-driven platforms \nsuch as Skill India Digital Hub have started addressing \ninfrastructure and access challenges. Offering online \ncourses in emerging technologies such as robotics, \ndata analytics and green energy, these platforms bring \nworld-class training to rural and semi-urban areas.111 \nAnother example is the reverse migration among \nIT professionals and renewable energy experts. \nReturning IT professionals, equipped with global \nexpertise in AI, blockchain and cybersecurity, could \nestablish cutting-edge technology start-ups or enhance \nthe digital infrastructure of existing enterprises and \nenable India to become a formidable force in the global \ntech economy. Similarly, renewable energy experts \ncould spearhead innovative projects in solar and wind \nenergy, contributing to India's ambitious green energy \ntransition and sustainability goals.\n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n44\n7.3.2 Recruitment and compliance: Navigating \ncomplex pathways\nThe process of navigating global standards and \nexamining the destination countries’ labour laws can \noften be intimidating for migrants. Successful recruitment \nnot only improves a country’s reputation as a source of \nskilled labour and also offers economic and social \nbenefits to employees as well as their families back \nhome. Transparency, fairness and compliance with \ninternational labour laws are central to this process. India \nhas steadily improved its recruitment processes by \nintroducing regulatory mechanisms to eliminate \nmalpractice and exploitation. \nThe eMigrate platform in India launched in 2015 is an \nexample of an important component of such reforms. By \nkeeping a database of accredited recruitment agencies \nand keeping track of placements of employees, the \nplatform minimises fraud and ensures that employees are \nfocused on legitimate opportunities.113 Specialised \nmodules within the platform teach employees about their \nrights and the legal requirements of destination countries.\nPre-departure orientation programmes, developed in \ncollaboration with the National Skill Development \nCorporation (NSDC), serve as an essential part of the \nrecruitment pipeline. These programmes provide workers \nwith practical knowledge of the laws, workplace \nexpectations and cultural nuances of host countries. For \nexample, Indian caregivers who go to Japan are given \nlanguage training under the Specified Skilled Worker \nprogramme and are informed about Japanese elderly \ncare practices.114 Such initiatives not only increase the \nwillingness of workers but also reduce the risk of conflicts \ndue to cultural misunderstandings. Overseas Workers \nResource Centre (OWRC) and Migrant Resource \nCentres (MRCs) run by the Ministry of External Affairs \nplay an essential role in supporting workers. These offer \ndocument verification, legal assistance and a \ncommunication channel for working families.115 \nMaintaining international labour laws is a critical \nrequirement for fair treatment of Indian workers abroad. \nBilateral agreements in existence, such as the India-\nGermany Migration and Mobility Partnership,116 illustrate \nbest practices to better align Indian workers’ rights with \nthe legal framework of host countries. These agreements \nfacilitate streamlined, quicker visa procedures and allow \nmutual recognition of skills thus facilitating employment. \nFor example, German employers who hire Indian IT \nprofessionals benefit from accelerated validation \nprocesses, while Indian workers gain access to secure \ncontracts and social protection.\nAnother key component of compliance is the existence of \na redressal system for complaints. Indian missions \nabroad, in cooperation with local authorities, have set up \nmechanisms to enable workers to report exploitation or \nunsafe conditions. Regular audits of recruitment \nagencies are conducted to ensure accountability, and \nviolations often lead to sanctions or withdrawal of \nlicenses.117 Such measures are expected to strengthen \nconfidence between workers, employers and \ngovernments and strengthen India’s position as a reliable \nsource of labour.\nIndia can draw lessons from the experience of the \nPhilippine Overseas Employment Administration \n(POEA). The POEA provides a robust regulatory \nframework guaranteeing ethical recruitment practices \nand protects employees through strict compliance \nchecks. For example, Filipino carers benefit from pre-\ndeparture briefings containing comprehensive \ninformation on employment contracts, wage structures \nand legal rights.118 The Philippines model not only \nemphasised transparency but also improved its global \nreputation, leading to preferential treatment in sectors \nsuch as care and construction.\n113 Ashwin Kumar, \"Uncovering the Skill-Migration Nexus in Sending States: Policy Analysis from India,\" (2024).

For Indian workers, a \nwell-planned and supportive transition process is \ncrucial to ensure success in their new roles and \nenvironments. By addressing both tangible and \nintangible aspects of migration, India can improve \nthe adaptability, satisfaction and productivity of \nworkers. The logistics of international relocations \nincludes complex coordination. Workers must \nsecure their work visas, undergo health screenings \nand arrange transport, often while navigating \nunknown bureaucratic processes. India’s eMigrate \nplatform has simplified this journey by providing a \ncentralised hub for documentation and visa \napplications.119 Pre-departure health check-ups, \nprescribed for workers on their way to countries with \nstrict public health regulations, ensure compliance \nwith host country rules and protect the well-being \nof workers.\nFinancial planning is another crucial element of the \nmigration process. Many workers leave dependent \npersons dependent on transfers for their livelihoods. \nWorkshops on financial literacy, carried out in \ncooperation with banks and NGOs, help employees \nto understand transfer systems, manage foreign \nexchange and avoid predatory financial practices.120 \nThese efforts ensure that employees can support \ntheir families and build financial security abroad. \nOnboarding goes beyond mere logistics and \nintegrates themes such as cultural assimilation and \nworkplace readiness. Cultural orientation \nprogrammes prepare workers for social standards, \nwork etiquette and language needs of host \ncountries, thus smoothening the integration \nprocess. These sessions not only improve the \nprofessional communication within their \nemployment, but also help them navigate daily life.\nGermany’s extensive integration courses constitute \na global benchmark. These programmes combine \nlanguage education, cultural education and \npreparation at the workplace, so that workers are \nwell-equipped to contribute to their host \ncommunities.121 For Indian workers in sectors such \nas IT and healthcare, these courses have proved \ntransformative, improving both productivity and \nlabour satisfaction. As India enhances its \ncooperation with Germany, including such practices \nin its on-boarding framework could bring \nsignificant benefits. \nIn addition to Germany, many other destination \ncountries have implemented effective programmes \naimed specifically at supporting migrant workers. \nSingapore’s Migrant Workers’ Centre (MWC) runs \ninitiatives that include skills training, workplace \nrights education and cultural orientation to ensure \nsmooth integration into local workplaces. In \nCanada, the Federal Skilled Worker Programme \n(FSWP) focuses on attracting skilled professionals, \noffering credential recognition, language training, \nand settlement support to help workers adapt \neffectively to Canadian labour markets. Sweden’s \nFast-Track Initiative (Snabbspår) targets newly \narrived skilled workers in sectors like education, \nhealthcare, and construction, providing accelerated \npathways for licensing and workplace integration. \nAmong the source countries, Philippines' \nComprehensive Pre-Departure Education \nProgramme (CPDEP) provides language training, \ncultural familiarisation, and stress management to \nprepare Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) for \nemployment abroad. These examples highlight the \npotential of comprehensive and worker-focused \nintegration frameworks, which India could adapt to \nenhance the success of its \noutbound workforce.\n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n46\n7.3.3 Return and reintegration: Unlocking potential back at home\n122 S.

Returning workers not only \nbring back financial savings, but also a wealth of \nknowledge, networks and international exposure.122 \nThe Skilled Workers Arrival Database for \nEmployment Support (SWADES), a joint initiative of \nthe Ministry of Skill Development and \nEntrepreneurship, the Ministry of Civil Aviation and \nthe MEA, aimed at creating a database of migrant \nworkers based on their skills and experience to meet \nthe requirements of Indian and foreign companies. \nIn order to facilitate employment, the SWADES \nregistration data were integrated into the portal Skill \nIndia’s Aatmanirbhar Skilled Employee-Employer \nMapping (SEEM).123 \nIn order to further leverage the expertise of \nrepatriates, India has developed sector-specific \nreintegration frameworks. In the IT sector, returning \nprofessionals are encouraged to teach at institutions \nwhere they can guide the next generation of \nengineers and technologists.124,125 These efforts \nfacilitate translation of globally acquired experiences \ninto domestic capacity building. Historically, one of \nthe most impactful ways in which repatriates \ncontribute is through entrepreneurship. The wave of \nreturning doctors in the 1980s, discussed earlier, \nplayed a crucial role in shaping Indian private \nhealthcare, which emerged as the majority care \nprovider in the past decades. Today, programmes \nlike Startup India offer funding, mentoring, and other \nbenefits to entrepreneurs to promote innovation \nacross sectors.126 \nIndia could also draw inspiration from Israel and \nChina, where returning scientists and entrepreneurs \nhave driven progress in technology and \nproduction.127 Through targeted incentives, these \ncountries have successfully reintegrated repatriated \nprofessionals who have created start-ups, \ndeveloped advanced technologies and strengthened \nthe national innovation ecosystem. By emulating this \nmodel, India can also develop a robust innovation \nhub and attract global investors and participants. \nAt the same time, reintegration is not without \nchallenges. Workers often find it difficult to adapt to \nthe domestic labour market and the social \nenvironment.128 Financial literacy programmes help \nrepatriates to manage savings and investments, \nwhile psychosocial support services address the \nemotional toll of adjustment. While there are strong \nnon-financial incentives to relocate to India,129 the \ncountry could also consider offering enhanced tax \nholidays or matching subsidies to repatriates \nwishing to set up companies to maximise their \ncontributions. With its demographic dividend \nprojected to peak in the coming decades, India \nstands at a pivotal juncture. Strategic investments in \neducation, skill development and healthcare are \nimperative to harness this potential, enabling the \nworkforce to meet evolving economic demands. \nNeglecting these areas could result in missed \nopportunities for economic growth and \ndevelopment.\n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n47\nThe evolving dynamics of the global labour market has \npresented countries with younger population like India \nwith the unprecedented opportunity to leverage its \ndemographic dividend and consolidate its position as a \ncrucial contributor to the international workforce. A well-\nstructured and adaptive strategy is essential to ensure \nthat workforce mobility is not only economically \nadvantageous but also sustainable in the long term. Such \na strategy must align with global employment trends, \nprotect the interests of workers, and optimise the \nreciprocal benefits for both supplier and host economies. \nThe following recommendations, grounded in technical \nand scenario analyses of the report, provide a framework \nfor advancing workforce mobility, skill enhancement and \nreintegration mechanisms to maximise developmental \noutcomes, for India and the world.\nMulti-tiered approach to skilling\nTo optimise the economic benefits of migration, countries \nmust adopt a comprehensive policy framework which \nintegrates economic, social and institutional dimensions. \nA tiered migration strategy should be developed to \naddress the distinct needs of high-skilled, mid-skilled and \nlow-skilled workers, which also focusses on harmonising \nskilling ecosystem as per international standards. Such \ndifferentiation will facilitate targeted policies that promote \nskill mobility while ensuring migrant welfare overseas. \nLeveraging and strengthening existing bilateral and \nmultilateral agreements will be crucial to standardising \ncredentials, streamlining visa pathways, recognition of \nskills and removing institutional bottlenecks that impede \nlabour market access in destination countries. \n08\nRecommendations\nFurthermore, countries must transition from a \ntransactional view of migration to a cyclical knowledge-\nexchange process. Establishing a global talent network \nwill facilitate sustained engagement with the diaspora \nfrom the country, fostering mentorship linkages, \nemployment updates, investment collaborations, \nupskilling opportunities and cross-border innovation \npartnerships. These mechanisms will not only enhance a \ncountry’s global labour footprint but also create reverse \nknowledge flows that contribute to domestic \neconomic progress.\nDemand-based skilling to enhance supply\nTo fully harness the demographic advantage, countries \nmust implement a data-driven and industry-aligned \nskilling ecosystem which dynamically responds to global \nworkforce demands. A forward-looking labour market \nintelligence system converged with existing migrant \ndatabases maintained by nodal ministries of the country \nshould be institutionalised to assess employment trends \nand anticipate skill shortages in key geographies. This \nwill enable the development of targeted skilling \nprogrammes that prepare workers for high-demand \nsectors such as healthcare in Japan, AI in Europe and \nsustainable energy in Australia. Herein, engagements \nwith the destination country employers may be actively \nundertaken by countries like India to advocate for a \ncountry’s supply strength, skill anticipation, labour market \ndemand aggregation and ecosystem enablement for \nlabour mobility along with placement opportunities.\nCountries like India should also expand structured \ninternational mobility programmes that facilitate career \ndevelopment through global exposure while preserving \npathways for return migration. These initiatives should be \naccompanied by comprehensive pre-departure training \nmodules covering language proficiency, cultural \norientation, and workplace adaptation strategies. \n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n48\nBy equipping workers with these competencies, countries \ncan enhance their integration prospects and long-term \nprofessional mobility in foreign labour markets. \nFurthermore, emphasis may be given to introduce online \nforeign language courses and cultural immersion \nprogrammes under the skilling programmes of the \ngovernment, Technical and Vocational Education and \nTraining (TVET) institutions and other institutions \npreparing candidates for migration. \nAdopting and creating innovative models of mobility\nA diversified and resilient workforce mobility strategy \nnecessitates the adoption of innovative models beyond \nconventional migration pathways. One such model is the \nOff-Shore Conclave framework, wherein destination \neconomies establish dedicated workforce enclaves \ndesigned to host foreign workers within sector-specific \nclusters. These zones can be structured with tailored \nlegal protections, regulatory oversight and social \ninfrastructure to enhance worker productivity while \naddressing host-country concerns regarding \nlarge-scale immigration.\nAdditionally, expanding structured young professionals \nand guest worker programmes which offer well-defined \nentry and exit pathways can create a sustainable model \nfor temporary labour mobility. Such programmes should \nincorporate provisions for skills accreditation, \nperformance-based contract extensions and structured \nreintegration mechanisms for returning workers. A robust \ngovernance must be established to ensure ethical \nrecruitment practices, minimise worker exploitation and \nmaintain transparent oversight of workforce \nmobility patterns.\nGreater focus on reintegration through technology\nFor international workforce mobility to yield enduring \nbenefits, reintegration strategies must be designed to \noptimise the knowledge and expertise of returning \nprofessionals. Establishing a national returnee workforce \ninitiative and upskilling agenda will facilitate a seamless \ntransition for repatriated workers by offering targeted \nincentives such as tax reliefs, entrepreneurship grants, \nand preferential hiring programmes in strategic \nindustries. Reintegration hubs should be developed to \nprovide tailored financial planning services, psychological \ncounselling and career development resources to ensure \nholistic support for returning workers.\nFurther, countries like India should invest in an AI-\nenabled workforce transition platform which \nsystematically maps the competencies of returnees to \nemerging domestic employment opportunities. This \ninitiative should be complemented by strengthened \npartnerships with international accreditation bodies to \nstandardise skill certifications, ensuring the continued \nemployability of Indian workers in global markets. \nA coordinated strategy encompassing both outbound \nmigration facilitation and returnee reintegration will \nposition such countries as a leader in international \nworkforce mobility while fostering inclusive \neconomic growth.\nExtending social security framework to include skill \nmigration – recommendations for India\n130 Ministry of Labour & Employment, Government of India, “Social Security for Gig and Platform Workers,” Press Release, November 25, 2024. \nRapid technological changes, rise of remote work and \nincreased automation has led to a transformational \nshift in labour employment away from traditional long-\nterm, location-based jobs to task-based work that can \nbe performed remotely. The rise of freelance work \nand the gig economy has enabled outsourcing of \ntasks to a flexible, globally distributed workforce \nwithout the need of any physical movement of labour. \nWhile technological advancements will further \nenhance demand for skilled labour, the de-linking of \nskills and services from labour currently underway is \nexpected to lead to increased global migration of \nskills, without cross border physical movement of \nlabour. This presents significant opportunities for \nglobal migration of Indian labour and skills but also \nposes challenges, particularly with regards to \nemployment stability and access to social security in \nabsence of well-crafted labour regulations pertaining \nto the same. \nBased on the above recommendations, Table 12 depicts \na set of mobility value chain guidelines which may be \nbeneficial for the various stakeholders of workforce \nmobility. \nHence, it is essential to design a supportive \nregulatory framework to facilitate the current \ndynamics. A key component of this will be expanding \nthe social safety net, currently available for domestic \nworkforce, to include freelancing and platforms \nworkers offering their services across geographies to \na global clientele. While gig and platform workers \nhave been defined in the Code on Social Security \n2020,130 and the government has set up a committee \nto suggest a social security framework for such \nworkers, its comprehensive and timely \nimplementation will be crucial in aiding the current \nlabour migration dynamics.\n\nPwC | Making the case for global workforce migration: A strategic blueprint to harness India’s demographic dividend\n49\nTable 12: Guidelines for mobility value chain\nKey operational steps\nStakeholders\nMedium for \nengagement \nRemarks\nDemand \nidentification \n•\nDestination market scan\nand demand landscape\nanalysis\n•\nRelevant\nministries/departments\n(foreign, education,\nlabour, etc.) in\ndestination countries\n•\nIndian missions in\ndestination countries\n•\nNiche/high value\nrecruiters\n•\nRecruitment platforms\n•\nRecruitment agencies\n•\nEmployer associations\n•\nG2G/G2G\npartnerships\n•\nConsultations/\nsummits/\nwebinars\n•\nRoadshows\n•\nThe research\nstudies\nincluding\ndemand\nmarket\nassessment,\nskill gap\nstudies may\nbe\ncommissioned\nby the central\ngoverning\nbody/\ndepartment in\ncollaboration\nwith research\nagencies.

    "pdf_content": "Indian family offices – \nthe new investors for \nIndia’s startup ecosystem\n\nA large segment of India’s high-net-worth families are \nsetting up organised structures to invest their family wealth. \nTraditionally, Indian promoter-led businesses have been \nconservative in their investment thesis. However, there \nhas been a surge of family offices in the past five years, \nespecially after the COVID-19 pandemic, where more and \nmore ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNIs) are trying \nto formalise and organise their wealth. While most family \noffices are in tier 1 cities, more families are setting up formal \nor similar family offices in tier 2 and tier 3 cities. The overall \nassets under management (AUM) of Indian family offices \nis still very small compared to the size and scale of global \nfamily offices which have AUM of trillions of dollars.1 \nThe evolving role of family offices \nA family office is an entity established to manage and \noversee the business, investment and personal affairs \nof a high-net-worth families engaged in the business or \nindividuals who are hoping to grow and transfer their \nwealth to the coming generations. The main aim of \nthese offices is to ensure the long-term preservation and \ngrowth of family wealth while addressing the family’s \nunique needs and objectives. \nA mature family office provides services around \ninvestment management, estate planning, tax advisory \nand philanthropy, and often function as a strategic team \nwhich provides stewardship to the family business by \nplaying the role of a custodian for the family’s capital. \nFor high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth families, \nmanaging their complex affairs requires a unified \nstrategy. Family offices help in streamlining this process \nby bringing together a team of experts and professionals. \nThey also help in identifying, managing and prioritising \ndifferent kinds of risks and customising investment plans \nto align them with the family’s vision and reflect their \ncore values. \n1\t\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/josipamajic/2024/09/09/rise-of-family-offices-trillion-dollar-shadows-in-global-finance/\n2   |    PwC Indian family offices – the new investors for India’s startup ecosystem\n\nThe symbiotic relationship between \nfamily offices and startups  \nThe start-up ecosystem has given rise to multiple \nopportunities for family offices. While earlier family offices \nfeared this asset class due to the risks related to these \ninvestments, many are now increasing their allocation \ntowards this asset class. Startups also prefer family offices \nas they have patient capital and are less demanding when \nit comes to a seat at the board, management information \nsystems (MIS) and operational oversight as compared to \nventure capitalists (VCs). The long-term capital provided \nby family offices supports sustainable growth and \nhelps startups avoid the pressures of rapid exits often \ndemanded by other investors. Family offices also offer \nenhanced credibility and access to a global network of \ninfluential contacts.\nSingle family offices in India have been actively investing \nin the startup ecosystem. They have specialist teams who \nunderstand the dynamics of an investment process and the \nassociated risks in startups. Multi-family offices facilitate \nsuch investment opportunities for their member family \noffices.  However, multi-family offices are also setting up \ntheir own fund structures – alternative investment fund \n(AIFs) – with select families which participate as LP, and \nthese funds then professionally invest in startups. This \nnew model reduces the risks for individual family offices \nas they have professional intermediaries who evaluate the \nquality of investment (parameters of evaluation include the \nfounder’s credentials, the business model which is being \ndeployed and the organisational strategy) and control the \ninvestment process.\nWhy family offices invest in \nstartups\n1\nAccess to new-age ideas and \ntechnology \nStartups are a high risk, high reward asset class and newer \nfamily offices are allocating portions of their portfolios for \nstartup investments as it allows them to diversify their \nportfolios and gain exposure to disruptive and innovative \ntechnologies and high-growth ventures, thus allowing them \nto access cutting-edge technologies and complement their \ntraditional investment assets. It also provides opportunities \nfor capital appreciation, higher return on investment \n(ROI) than traditional investments, and an opportunity to \nnetwork with the brightest and the most innovative minds \nin the industry.\n2\nImpact investing \nSome family offices are also investing in startups which \ncreates social impact or addresses environmental related \nconcerns. It also allows them to brand themselves, through \nassociation, as conscious modern businesses.\n3\nDiversification \nInvesting into the startup ecosystem allows the new \ngeneration of family businesses to diversify into newer \nbusinesses and sectors without disturbing their core \nfamily business. This addresses an important element of \ncontinuity of ‘family togetherness’ by allowing the next gen \nto experiment without inhibitions.  For example, some of the \nstartups have been seeded by the new gen family members \nthrough initial funding from their own family office and then \nlater raised funds from outside VCs and PEs.\n3   |    PwC  Indian family offices – the new investors for India’s startup ecosystem\n\n4   |    PwC Indian family offices – the new investors for India’s startup ecosystem\nWays in which family offices can \ninvest in startups\n1\nDirect investments \nThese can be done via equity investments in startups, \nbecoming shareholders and potentially gaining board \nseats. Direct investments can be made during the seed \nfunding stage which comprises investing the initial capital \nfor startups to kickstart their business or via the later-stage \nfunding rounds of series A/B/C, where startups have a more \nestablished business model along with a fair amount of the \ndesired market validation. Investing via convertible notes – \ndebt instruments which convert into equity at a later stage \n– often during a future funding round, is another approach. \nThis route offers some downside protection while retaining \nthe equity upside. \n2\nVC funds\nPutting money in VC funds which focus on startup \ninvestments has often proven to be a safe approach. This \nprovides exposure to a diversified portfolio of startups and \nmitigates the risk arising from investing in a single startup. \nVCs also often provide co-investment opportunities to their \nLPs, enabling family offices to invest along with them in \nspecific startups. \n3\nAngel networks \nJoining angel investor networks gives family offices the \nopportunity to co-invest with other experienced investors, \nhelping them leverage the advantages from a quality deal \nflow and shared due diligence. \n4\nIncubators and accelerators:\nInvesting in or partnering with incubators and accelerators \nenables family offices to gain early access to promising \nstartups and the opportunity to mentor them through their \ngrowth stages, thus providing the former with an edge in \ntheir investment practices.\n5\nCorporate VC\nThis includes setting up a corporate venture arm in the \nscenario where the family office has a formidable business \nturnover. This permits strategic investments in those \nstartups which align with the family office’s business \noperations and strategic goals.\n\n5   |    PwC  Indian family offices – the new investors for India’s startup ecosystem\nKey considerations for investing \ninto startups\nThe following factors must be taken into consideration \nbefore investing in startups:\nThe founding team\nThe educational and family background, capabilities, \nmotivation and vision of the founders are critical factors. \nThe founding team must have a business plan, roadmap \nand milestones carved out for their business.\nDue diligence \nConducting a comprehensive due diligence, assessing \nthe size of the total addressable market (TAM), figuring out \nthe financial KPIs along with ensuring legal and regulatory \ncompliance should be considered before investing. \nIt is important to keep negative branding and risks of \nlitigation at bay.\nSector focus\nA targeted approach towards key sectors with strategic \nintent is important for enhancing the probability of success \nfor the family office. While the original sector in which they \noperate is a good starting point for considering startups \nin the same space many family offices are also exploring \nnew-age sectors such as renewable energy, FinTech, \nHealthTech and other emerging sectors to invest in.\nRisk management\nIt is recommended to diversify investments into different \nventures. strategic investment plan spread across the \ndifferent stages and lifecycles of a startup helps mitigate the \nrisks of a sunk cost.\nExit strategies\nFamily offices should have a clearly defined exit plan, along \nwith timelines. Terms of separation should be discussed \nand agreed upon before making the investment. These \nterms may include initial public offerings, mergers and \nacquisitions, buybacks, secondary sale of equity and other \nterms. It is common practise to invest at a more advanced \nstage in startups on their path towards IPO, to help them \nget better returns for the investor.\nEarlier, family offices were comfortable with investing into \nstartups as a follow-up investment to qualified VCs (usually \ntop-tier VCs) as they relied on the diligence and judgement \nof such investors. However, this investment by family offices \ndid not augur well for them always, as the VCs’ investment \nthesis allowed them to lose money on select investments \n(usually offset by bumper returns in other investments \nin the larger pool). Secondly, post investment, VCs are \nused to having their own peculiar ways of managing their \ninvestments, including using board seats effectively. They \nalso have competent teams to analyse the MIS of such \ninvestments. On the other hand, family offices are usually \nunderstaffed, thereby making this form of investments \ncomparatively risky. Therefore, family offices which \nbelieve in investing in startups regularly need to develop \ninhouse capabilities (with due augmentation from external \nprofessionals) to undertake their own due diligence with \nrespect to financial, commercial, legal or human resources \naspects in order to take informed decisions pertaining to the \nbusiness’s long-term viability. Although this process may \nprove to be expensive, it will help them to undertake proper \nevaluation and thus make gainful investments. \n\n2\t\nhttps://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/indian-fintech-market-expected-to-reach-usd-150-bn-in-valuation-by-2025-mos-\nfinance/articleshow/92087752.cms?from=mdr\n3\t\nhttps://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-digital-payments-market-will-more-than-triple-to-10-trillion-by-2026-report/\narticleshow/98522718.cms?from=mdr\n4\t\nhttps://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-400-million-poor-now-have-access-to-banks-due-to-pradhan-mantri-jan-dhan-yojana-finance-\nministry/story-V7ZTGA4VES6PqUIbG8kAOJ.html\nSome of the key sectors in which family offices are investing in are: \n1\nFinTech\nIndia is home to many of startups in the FinTech space. The \nIndian FinTech space is touted to grow to USD 150 billion by \n2025 at a CAGR of 22% since 2021.2 The growth is a factor \nof rising digital adoption among a burgeoning technologically \ncomfortable youth, and a growing demand for new age \nproducts. Family offices have made investments in payment \nplatforms, lending businesses, and Insurtech solutions. \nFurther, digital payments in India are going to be in excess \nof USD 10 trillion by 2026.3 This will be made possible by \npolicy initiatives, and a business environment favoured \ntowards this goal.\nIn the last ten years, more than 400 million new bank \naccounts have been operationalised in India as part of our \nfinancial inclusion initiatives such as Jan Dhan Yojana,4 This \nsignificant increase emphasises the potential of the FinTech \nmarket catering the rural and underserved populace.\n4\nArtificial intelligence (AI)\nThe increased adoption of AI technologies across industries \nis driving the growth of several AI-related startups. This has \nled to increased investor interest, including family offices, \nwho are evaluating and investing into such businesses. This \nsurge in investment shows strong investor confidence in \nIndia’s AI capabilities and the potential for high returns.\nThe amount of data being generated by both traditional \nand new-age companies requires a dedicated analytical \nengine (hardware and software) and monetisation strategy \nto increase the profit margins of such companies. To cater \nto this demand, several startups are creating products \npertaining to both these areas, and family offices are \nevaluating and investing into such startups extensively. \nApart from these considerations, it is important that family \noffices create a detailed investment thesis or policy covering \nthe following details:\n•\t\nsector focus\n•\t\ntheme\n•\t\nsize and minimum percentage\n•\t\nrisk considerations\n•\t\ncontrol (including board seats)\n•\t\nstage of monetisation\n•\t\nminimum return expected\n•\t\ndilution\n•\t\nnature of founding team.\nAs family offices in India expand their role in managing \ncomplex, multi-generational wealth and increasing \ninvestments into the startup ecosystem, they also \nencounter challenges around the complexity of regulations \nand taxes of holding structures. However, regulations \nand tax provisions are usually covered under the cost of \ndoing business in any part of the world, and most family \noffices hire experienced professionals to manage such \ncomplexities. \nFamily offices are getting increasingly confident about \nstartups as a separate and remunerative asset class. \nHowever, as they embark on their investment journey or \nscale it, they need to be careful and confident about their \ninvestment thesis, processes and risks and strategise how \nthey will manage and monitor the same while ensuring that \nthe investment plan and thesis have been customised to fit \nthe family’s framework and core values.\n3\nHealthcare and HealthTech\nFor family offices that are inclined towards theme-based \ninvestments, healthcare offers a huge opportunity. The \nhealthcare industry is undergoing rapid transformation owing \nto technological advancements, changing demographics and \nevolving consumer expectations. These shifts are providing \nbusiness opportunities in the pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, \nmedical devices, telemedicine and HealthTech. \n6   |    PwC Indian family offices – the new investors for India’s startup ecosystem\nDue to the growing middle class, increasing disposable \nincomes and changing lifestyles, there is a rising demand \nfor diverse consumer products and services. In the past, \nmany Indian families have created businesses around \nconsumers, and are now using family office structures \nto invest into new-age consumer businesses (essentially \ndriven by technology) to learn and understand changing \nconsumer preferences and buying habits.  \nThe health and wellness segment has been gaining \nconsiderable traction, with more consumers prioritising \ntheir well-being and holistic living. Family offices \nare also investing in brands which lay emphasis on \nsocial responsibility and eco-friendly practices due to \nsustainability becoming a key consideration for consumers. \nThe rise of e-commerce has changed how consumers shop, \nleading family offices to invest in online retail platforms and \ndirect-to-consumer brands which use the nuances of social \nmedia to identify, acquire and service customers in all parts \nof the country without any physical interaction.\n2\nConsumer-centric businesses \nand platforms\n\nStartups are an asset class which provides more than \nfinancial returns to a family office as it allows its next gen to \nexperiment and learn beyond their comfort zone.  However, \nit is important that the investment should be aligned to the \nvalues and vision of the family business. Startups and their \nfounders can also learn from the family office counsel. The \necosystem of a family office and its businesses can be used \nas a base for the proof of concept by startups.\nThe relationship between family offices and startups is \nincreasingly becoming a merger of the old and the new, the \ntraditional and the modern, and experience and innovation. \nBeing a growing hub for family offices and startups, India \nhas the potential to leveage the benefits of both these \nentities and develop a sustainable business environment.\nConclusion\n7   |    PwC  Indian family offices – the new investors for India’s startup ecosystem\n\npwc.in\nData Classification: DC0 (Public)\nIn this document, PwC refers to PricewaterhouseCoopers Private Limited (a limited liability company in India having Corporate Identity Number or CIN : \nU74140WB1983PTC036093), which is a member firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited (PwCIL), each member firm of which is a separate \nlegal entity.\nThis document does not constitute professional advice.
