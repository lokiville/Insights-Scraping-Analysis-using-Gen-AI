likely privatization reached that point in 2023 3 all signs suggest the gap is widening on both sides governments are trying to balance a range of funding priorities and that is reducing their fiscal capacity for infrastructure at the same time demand for new and more resilient infrastructure is climbing driven by economic jamie samograd environmental technical and social pressures closing the gap will be a key priority for governments around the world national industry leader infrastructure frustratingly the solution to closing this gap has been obvious for some kpmg in canada time governments

trend trend trend trend 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 what s more many of the world s leading institutional investors are the good news is that perceptions and biases seem to be rapidly extraordinarily good at managing and even improving infrastructure assets evolving following national elections in more than 60 countries in 2024 as sources of patient capital their investment strategies align nicely with many of which saw incumbents ejected or weakened we are seeing this year we expect to see significant competition infrastructure lifecycles and as fiduciaries of their clients retirement savings a change of political perspectives around the world many of those new between states to attract and capture patient they are keenly focused on stability across the asset lifecycle governments are proving to be more commercial more realist and more capital open to new ideas than their predecessors yet with a few notable exceptions most governments remain reluctant to transfer assets to the private sector they know they have built citizen openness to the privatization of infrastructure is also on the rise in this environment governments will need to start assessing their portfolios up unsustainable levels of public debt but many consider infrastructure according to the most recent edelman trust barometer citizens globally of assets to understand what can be brought to market what assets require to be the remit of the public sector and they worry about the impact are about 10 percentage points more likely to trust business versus more support to become commercially viable and what assets must remain of privatization on service quality access and affordability simply put government 5 this suggests that many citizens would now be more on the government books and they will want to provide some guidance to governments recognize the solution but are wary of pursuing it comfortable with some infrastructure assets moving into private hands investors around the types of assets they will bring to market and associated and ownership timelines messaging to citizens and to national pension funds and reset 2025 institutional investors will also be key our prediction and advice much will change in 2025 in some countries rising bond yields on government treasuries will increase the cost of capital for governments this year we expect to see significant competition between states to attract for their part institutional investors will need to become more proactive as at the same time we are seeing the retreat of bilateral investment and capture patient capital some countries will follow india s lead by creating a gradual increase of new assets comes to market likely sector by sector particularly from china and development aid which is further a national asset monetization pipeline nmp alongside central bodies to given the complexity of the transactions and the quantum of investment undermining emerging market fiscal capacity for those making local accelerate growth and attract private investment within specific sectors for required institutional investors would be wise to start identifying targets and currency investments a rising us dollar is adding to financial woes example the nhai in the roads sector or the seci in renewable energy asset classes that align to their investment strategies and begin their due diligence outreach and internal discussions as soon as possible at the same time demand for new infrastructure will likely skyrocket many will focus on creating clear and consistent pipelines of assets to bring this year as citizens put pressure on governments to deliver quick wins to market supported by clear regulatory regimes and transparent oversight the great privatization is coming preparation will be key more resilient infrastructure and more modernized services for many that protects citizen outcomes while encouraging innovation reinvestment countries the ability to deliver on these expectations will likely be key to and reasonable returns for private sector investors clear cost benefit helping ensure social and economic stability going forward messaging to citizens often by aligning the sale of a particular asset with the development of a new asset or service will likely also be key the good news is that perceptions and biases seem to be rapidly evolving 5 2025 edelman trust barometer edelman

undermining efficiency and killing the environment in search of in the era of next day delivery one might imagine that global supply chains are tight efficient and aligned yet that is not the case in fact the reality is that most elements of global supply chains are fractured standards unstandardized and misaligned and that is creating massive commercial and environmental challenges for companies suppliers and customers around the world prahlad tanwar looking across global supply chains we see three key areas of partner global head of logistics postal services misalignment the first is infrastructure it s not just the quality and kpmg in india consistency of roads rails and ports which differ significantly and impact prahladtanwar kpmg com the efficiency of supply chains across markets and regions it s also prahlad tanwar things like warehouses trucks pallets and operating systems every prahlad is the global head of logistics postal services with switch caused by inconsistent standards adds cost and carbon 20 years of transport and logistics consulting and industry regulation is another area of increasing friction on the one hand experience spanning india china u s germany uae organizations need to comply with a myriad of different regulations related oman and kuwait prahlad supports kpmg clients including to transportation logistics and trade at the same time governments are logistics operators pe investors regulators and end users promulgating new regulations like cbam in the eu to regulate supply on transport and logistics initiatives solutions include m a chain sustainability even something as simple as different nomenclatures assistance market entry commercial due diligence growth can add friction to the supply chain strategy cost optimization and sales and procurement transformation most elements of global supply chains are fractured unstandardized and misaligned 8 the great reset emerging trends in infrastructure and

trend trend trend trend 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 the third area of misalignment relates to processes reporting processes which means nobody is really focused on driving standardization across operational processes supply chain processes and system processes for global supply chains example these tend to be locally derived often tailored by customer and reset 2025 shipment and contain significant variations these can add cost carbon and these friction points are creating massive challenges risk to the supply chain as vendors try to align to different processes across this year expect to see supply chains come under massive pressure as for their business operations their customer pool trade wars start to heat up and new tariffs and regulations are imposed in key markets indeed based on recent rhetoric from politicians globally what supply chain leaders are increasingly recognizing is that these friction all signs suggest we are entering a dynamic period characterized by the points are creating massive challenges for their business operations friction what we will see however is a clear recognition that something must be implementation of tariffs and counter tariffs agility will be key and inconsistency can drive up costs create more carbon increase risks and done we expect to see much greater attention on this issue from regulators reduce efficiency it can make planning and investment more complex and keen to create greater alignment across markets in order to reduce the at the same time expect to see rising demand on companies to assess challenging it can reduce flexibility and agility and it impacts supply chain burden on businesses and unlock new growth industry bodies led by port and manage their scope 3 emissions within their supply chain in part transparency standardization would allow supply chain leaders to create air and transport groups will likely start to build consensus around a case this will be driven by new and likely inconsistent regulations on supply more efficient and resilient operations for change oems and other giant purchasing organizations should jump on chain sustainability it will also be in response to growing demand for board recognizing the immense value that standardization can deliver transparent carbon reporting from investors and customers supply the problem is that there are no central authorities responsible for supply chains will be under the microscope chain standardization in most cases supply chain processes and operations for infrastructure owners developers operators and investors the drive are defined by customers big retailers for example often dictate the rules for standardization will likely bring significant long term value but the shift the combination should force supply chain efficiency up the corporate of engagement to their suppliers both for commercial and sustainability should happen fairly quickly in relative terms infrastructure players should agenda as organizations seek to create more flexible efficient and reasons global industry bodies have been slow or reluctant to drive be seriously considering how they can start helping to shape and drive resilient supply chains that in turn should encourage governments change regulators are moving at different speeds and often with different standards within their spheres of influence and they should be carefully and industry bodies to more carefully study the issue and in an ideal objectives national governments are wary of overstepping their bounds examining how the implementation of standards might influence their current world start collaborating with organizations to lead the charge towards plans designs and investments supply chain standardization supply chain standardization will be a boon for companies consumers and our prediction and advice the climate infrastructure players should embrace it wholeheartedly to be clear this trend is more about a change in mindsets rather than nobody is really focused on driving standardization measurable action on the ground it takes years for standards to be across global supply chains promulgated socialized and finalized it takes even longer for them to be implemented consistently around the world indeed this will be a year of supply chain standardization will be a boon for conviction versus action companies consumers and the

making is simply effective leadership who wouldn t want missing middle to know where the risks are in the supply chain what cfo would turn down the opportunity to identify where they can cut waste

evident reset 2025 should demand more transparent sustainability information from suppliers storms and climate emergencies are becoming more common business governments will likely leverage their spend to embed sustainability costs are rising as leaders grapple with new supply chain and financing risks which brings us back to the missing middle the reality is that many requirements particularly in priority policy areas like housing the natural environments on which so many businesses depend are under organizations public and private have made public commitments attack since 1970 the monitored population of mammals birds amphibians that they are not setting themselves up to meet they recognize the risks that will require leaders to reassess their commitments and policies to help reptiles and fish have declined by an average of 73 percent 8 that lie ahead yet the focus remains on cost driven thinking rather than ensure that on a day to day basis their organizations are doing things focusing on value protection or value creation that actually align with their objectives and ambitions it can also require a thankfully the recognition that we are reliant on nature is becoming clear understanding of what s within their direct sphere of influence and mainstream in part as a result of helpful initiatives like the taskforce inspired by a more holistic view of the risks and opportunities we believe what is not for many that will likely mean focusing more clearly on high on nature related financial disclosures tnfd which has published 2025 will see governments and businesses start to focus on resetting quality data informing decision making and capital portfolio management recommendations and guidance aimed at helping organizations report on that missing middle it will be a year where leaders try to align ambition to identify every asset their operating condition their performance and nature related issues within their businesses and take action on them with action intent with investment and objectives with outcomes their value to the organization and its objectives only then can the appropriate solutions and roadmaps start to become apparent our prediction and advice driven by key regulations and motivated by prudent corporate supply chain we have entered a new era in the transition to a sustainable future management we expect business

we re among the frustrated from digital twins prophets yet uptake has been disappointingly slow for good reasons only a few years ago the cost and complexity of developing a good david smallbone digital twin was sky high it took years just to collect the data standardize it and drop it into a data lake the software tended to be highly technical partner infrastructure advisory group and required legions of programmers and data scientists to set up even kpmg in the uk then a lack of interoperability between systems often meant that scope david smallbone kpmg co uk was limited as a

the loop decision making new and operators improve their decision making they would also allow them analytics tools like digital twins will need to be adopted and developed to better plan and more rapidly adjust their investments as technologies operating models should also be assessed new asset classes and market conditions and definitions of value change they would enable traditional

maintainers technology service and regulators and it would unlock transparent and robust reporting to key providers and so on that may require more sophisticated governance and stakeholders and regulators the problem is that new asset classes don t always act like the traditional operating models infrastructure they are embedded within they will have different lifespans it will likely also require a shift in the talent and competencies of the maintenance requirements and replacement schedules they will require organization from top to bottom decision makers should get comfortable different types of contracting terms service level agreements and policies expect to see many infrastructure owners and with a much more dynamic faster and more data driven approach to their business

future engineering and construction companies need to be for a variety of reasons economic political and social we expect experimenting piloting and adopting new methods and ways of working our advice is to start building the foundations that the pressure on construction companies to grow exponentially this digital natives are not looking to spend their careers conducting boring will be required to drive value from your technology year particularly within sectors where public demand is exploding manual processes they want new technologies better visualization greater construction companies serving the energy and infrastructure sectors will investments innovation and more digitally enabled workplaces as older employees start likely come under the greatest pressure to innovate so too will those to retire the pressure will be on to transfer knowledge and ways of working operating in markets with very scarce resources to these newer generations of employees our prediction and advice on the plus side we see a rapid democratization of technology helping the problem is that generally speaking the construction industry we expect this trend to start slowly within key sectors but then drive adoption across the construction sector software solutions are is going backwards on innovation whereas many companies in other accelerate rapidly across industries and markets as value is proven becoming more affordable and accessible with leading vendors now non tech sectors tend to spend 2 to 3 percent of revenues on innovation owner awareness increases and competition heats up in some offering light versions of their core solutions supported by key adoption many construction and engineering companies don t spend anything at markets the pace of change will likely be driven by the bigger e c tools such as check lists and startup guides that make the solutions more all according to kpmg s global construction survey 2023 less than half general contractors who will work with their suppliers and subs to accessible to more employees similarly access to new ai tools and of e c sector organizations have invested in pmis project management implement new technologies that enable better collaboration and functionality is rising rapidly as these technologies become embedded information system or basic data analytics technologies 9 fewer still have project management adoption will also be driven by the structuring and into existing solutions and tools adopted bim mobile platforms or drone technologies uptake of new contracting models that provide appropriate incentives there have also been positive developments on the contracting for innovation to be fair most construction companies are facing significant challenges and risk side with a growing number of owners now opting for cost to innovation margins remain razor thin few have the available capital to with this in mind our advice is to start building the foundations that will reimbursement contracts that allow them to properly understand invest into transformational technologies particularly if there is no clear path be required to drive value from your technology investments get control assess and allocate risks in a more transparent and effective way and to recouping the cost over a series of projects since most projects today of your data recruit new talent and build key capabilities assess and that is encouraging construction leaders to explore and propose new are structured as fixed price turnkey contracts much of the technology enhance your supply chain with a focus on suppliers who share your approaches and technologies as they build their bid and innovation risk falls onto the construction company which is fine for quest for innovation and consider whether your operating models are still well understood projects like office buildings but more challenging when it fit to drive the innovation you require comes to more complex projects in for example the energy sector the reality is that innovation is one of the only sustainable ways most e c companies are also ill prepared to take on new technologies construction companies can start to do more with less without eating and drive innovation construction companies have historically struggled into their already meager margins it s time to start innovating to attract digitally savvy talent capable of transforming the organization we expect the pressure on construction companies and sustaining innovation many of the foundational elements required to grow exponentially this year particularly within to enable new technologies like cloud computing data analytics and digitized processes are lacking even if construction companies had the sectors where public demand is exploding capital to invest in

leadership level cybersecurity culture is learning and tailored communications evident by the priority placed on cybersecurity projects cybersecurity culture through cybersecurity success starts with how leaders actively aim to keep their organization the managerial mechanism of secure and keep up their knowledge of cybersecurity cross functional leadership demonstrating secure behavior at the

an organization teams work together to help keep the organization extending from an individual level to the full ecosystem of the walk and talking the talk secure and through helping each other with technical business and its suppliers and partners leaders need to drive skills it is an environment where employees feel cybersecurity culture through the managerial mechanism comfortable reporting

22002244 rreeppoorrtt 2200 visionary and strategic leadership it has been said that truly visionary leaders begin own leadership style this ongoing development with a clean slate of paper and then reimagine the where an initial sense of self doubt gives way to world yet creating a reimagined world is conviction and confidence creates a pipeline of impossible without a route map this is where leaders strategic leadership comes in as jack welch has observed before you are a when leaders craft a vision for the future they leader success is all about growing yourself when must also be able to pick people motivate them you become a leader success is all about growing and make sure they have the capacity to actualise others this is perhaps the best way to summarise the vision knowing well that framing a vision itself the journey towards visionary and strategic is fraught with risk sometimes the way middle leadership management and frontline managers perceive the vision might be different from the picture that leaders have in mind the efficacy of visionary and forward thinking leadership thus depends on the leader or leadership group s ability to articulate a cohesive vision that creates alignment empathy ownership and association across the hierarchy for this to happen meaningfully there is a need for a professional and proactive culture that makes it possible to anticipate potential challenges and steer teams toward shared objectives it is also useful to develop an environment that accommodates different leadership styles strengthens problem solving fosters innovation enhances creativity and encourages calculated risk taking the last aspect is especially important since effective leadership is about boldness and decisiveness at the same time the vision should not be unicentric placing excessive emphasis on a leader s vision makes it difficult to explore potentially valuable alternative ideas this leads to a lack of objectivity especially when the current vision needs to be refined or replaced with a more effective one for a given environment a second challenge relates to sustaining momentum while visionary leaders excel at inspiring teams maintaining impetus may sometimes be challenging due to inconsistent follow through the obsession of certain leaders about the future might lead them to overlook operational challenges or opportunities that exist in the near term the longevity of the vision could also suffer if it relies heavily on a leader s individual traits and if there isn t a robust succession plan in place some of these shortcomings can be overcome by certain exemplary leaders who are able to inspire and instil confidence about achieving goals and sunil kant munjal fulfilling aspirational targets by

gen ai as both data capabilities and ai to unlock its next wave of digital transformation a risk and an opportunity but the risks of falling behind and or making a fatal error in terms of the energy sector is at a pivotal crossroads facing unprecedented this report advocates that energy leaders must leverage data and challenges and opportunities addressing the challenges and seizing decisiveness to drive the next wave of digital transformation within privacy ethics or integrity the energy transition opportunities will require a unified approach their organizations by methodically experimenting with ai use cases can be managed while there is that integrates technology data and strategy across the entire and leveraging cyber security frameworks energy companies can hardly an area of business where business this dual challenge demands innovative solutions and protect against threats that could hinder digital innovation while ai can t bring value integrating strategic foresight making it imperative for energy leaders to leverage the energy sector matches or surpasses other industries in many it advanced technologies and data driven insights to drive the next disciplines achievements are often confined to isolated functional ai really comes down to change wave of digital transformation areas rather than spanning entire organizations or ecosystems management and that s something ceos should feel confident about as our research finds that the energy sector is more resilient and as technological innovation opens new potential in the energy long as they have the fundamental willing to take risks than other sectors but it needs to increase sector a balance needs to be struck between rapid adoption and investments in data capabilities and

experimentation difficult to track and compare crowdsourcing use cases from their workforces the most popular which of the following best describe how your company is tracking expenditure and return on poorly integrated initiatives is even approach is open collaboration where diverse working groups experimenting with potential ai use cases more pressing given organizations expect to increase

approach and steer away from department across our business were looking for human empathy this example shows how truly overly stringent approval processes to avoid stifling innovation one listening to customers can guide to the right path for delivering real way of balancing speed with risk is driving alignment through cross 40 value and it s a reminder that ai should be a tool or collaborator for functional coes or user groups and only centrally managing ai human workers rather than a replacement initiatives that those groups identify as high risk or high complexity more centralized organizations should move away from disjointed ai use cases and selective collaboration regardless of their chosen experimentation approach organizations adopt a portfolio approach towards ai focus on

have noticed different fis globally face challenges in their journey of ifrs9 indas109 asc 326 implementation which are on account of data availability model methodology process set up resource planning information technology infrastructure governance and controls and management information system as per rbi guidelines fis should have independent three lines of defence to manage model risk and as per that all ecl models should be independently validated before deployment as well as periodically monitored and validated as per mrm policy of the fi model validator to conduct comprehensive

imperative that different stakeholders understand the requirements and enhance process accordingly key areas that will be impacted by the ecl framework include pricing liquidity asset liability management operations icaap regulatory compliance reputation risk appetite and limits stress testing and other fair value regulations as highlighted in this paper ecl provisions requirements will not only impact credit department but all other aspects of business and risk management of the fis thus it is imperative that fis should design target operating model tom in such a way that the framework

robust constituted a nine member committee to ecl framework recommend framework for ecl loan loss provisioning for indian financial institutions fis final guidelines basis the recommendations of the committee are expected to be released by rbi and thus it is imperative for all indian fis to work towards implementing ecl computation policies and framework 1 introduction of expected credit loss framework for provisioning by banks issued by the reserve bank of india in january 2023 4 expected credit loss ecl 2 expected credit loss ecl framework as ecl will impact financial statements of the fi below are the key considerations for effective it is imperative that the framework is robust which implementation of ecl framework adheres with applicable regulatory guidelines and industry best practices once ecl is implemented 01 business model and solely payment of fis need to compute either 12 month or lifetime ecl principal and interest sppi policy for the facility from the day of loan disbursement this will impact the financial statements of the fi 02 including profitability capital adequacy and other modelling for ecl and its components such financial indicators as stage segmentation pd lgd and ead basis our experience it is important that different 03 departments including underwriting treasury model document policies and sops finance risk it and operations should have good 04 understanding of the framework and work closely validation of models to ensure that the impact of adoption of such a framework is not large for the bank also as part of 05 target operating model tom there should be financial reporting and disclosures clearly defined roles and responsibilities of all these departments to ensure minimum volatility on the 06 statement of profit and loss due to governance and controls movement of provisions as per ifrs9 fis can compute ecl basis different methods below are three approaches as provided in standard to compute impairment losses basis underlying asset general measurement simplified approach purchased or originated model gmm credit impaired poci under this approach stage under this approach fis have assessment is not required and this approach is applicable for to assess the stage of the lifetime ecl is computed assets which are credit facility and accordingly generally this approach is impaired either at origination compute ecl for next used for assets such as trade or purchased as credit 12 month or lifetime ecl for receivable and lease receivable impaired generally lifetime most of the assets such as where there is no significant ecl is computed for such retail loans corporate loans financing component assets and credit adjusted and bonds will be computed effective interest rate ceir is under this approach used to discount the ecl in the next section of the paper we have elaborated on key components for the most common approach as used for impairment calculation i e pd lgd approach which forms a part of gmm expected credit loss ecl 5 3 development of different ecl components in general different ecl frameworks ifrs9 indas 109 asc 326 are principal based and do not prescribe a single method that is to be used for ecl computation as per asc 326 20 an entity may use discounted cash flow methods loss rate methods roll rate methods probability of default methods or methods that utilise an aging schedule to compute allowance for credit loss 2 in our experience most common approach to compute ecl is based on pd lgd and ead estimation under this approach fis can compute ecl basis below formula t ecl pd lgd ead d t t t t t 1 where pd is probability of default which defines the likelihood that the borrower will default on its obligations when they come due within specific time lgd is loss given default which defines the amount that the fi will lose in case a borrower defaults on its obligations ead is exposure at default which defines the exposure that will be at risk in case a borrower defaults on its obligations this will include principle outstanding accrued interest and future interest that the fi is expecting to receive during the lifetime of the contract d is discount rate which can be computed as effective interest rate eir under gmm and simplified approach or credit adjusted effective interest rate ceir under poci approach 2 financial instruments credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb in june 2016 6 expected credit loss ecl expected credit loss ecl 6 below we will discuss on different key components to be considered by fis while computing ecl using this method 3 1 definition of default fis should have clear and consistent default in our view fis should assess different portfolios and definition we have noted that many fis do not either finalise definition of default once the definition is have defined definition or have different default finalised fis can move to next steps of data definition for different purposes such as internal collection basis good and bad customers also any credit risk management regulatory reporting change in default definition should be applied financial reporting ecl computation capital prospectively for computation purposes adequacy and any other internal monitoring purposes an fi can use guidelines as issued by rbi as well as other regulators such as european banking authority eba for this purpose some of the parameters that can be considered as part of default definition are listed below 1 counterparty classified as npa 2 exposure to counterparty is restructured or modified due to financial difficulties 3 counterparty facing financial difficulty and is unlikely to pay which can be assessed basis different parameters 3 2 segmentation segmentation or pooling refers to dividing the portfolio basis homogenous risk characteristics all facilities should have homogenous risks within a segment pool and heterogenous risks between any two segments pools some of the parameters that can be considered for creating segments are geography such as base country or continent india rest asia europe region north 1 south east west city tier one tier two metro 2 portfolio type such as corporate nbfc sme retail home loan trade receivables 3 borrower characteristics such as salaried business age gender income risk rating score portfolio characteristics such as secured unsecured vintage basis month of 4 book maturity of loan portfolio management such as internal policy for credit screening underwriting monitoring 5 credit policy business projections quantitative methods such as k means clustering principal component analysis pca 6 classification and regression tree cart in general we have seen fis perform segmentation basis portfolio type only without any further analysis which in our view will not suffice the regulatory requirement fis should perform further quantitative and qualitative analysis basis different parameters to segment pool the portfolio expected credit loss ecl 7 3 3 significant increase in credit risk sicr under ecl requirements fis will need to compute ecl for either next 12 month or for remaining lifetime depending on the change in credit risk since initial recognition of the facility fis need to classify the facilities in either of the three stages as highlighted below stage 1 facilities which do not have significant increase in credit risk and thus 12 month ecl to be computed for such facilities stage 2 facilities which have significant increase in credit risk and thus lifetime ecl to be computed for such facilities stage 3 facilities which are in default basis default definition or serving cool off period fis can use different quantitative and qualitative should be decided additionally fis should identify parameters to assess change in credit risk some of other relevant parameters to assess sicr and the quantitative and qualitative parameters that can accordingly classify facilities in different stages be used to assess increase in credit risk are fis should also conduct regular back testing as part pd comparison lifetime or 12 month pd of the validation of sicr criteria and add remove any comparison at inception and reporting date parameter basis the same some of the methods that fis can use for back testing are rating pd movement beyond certain threshold notch 1 type i and type ii error to identify false positive and false negative in assessment of credit risk regulatory backstop of 30 and 90 dpd 2 roll forward backward analysis of facilities restructured modified due to financial difficulties moving in different stages should be relatively watchlist or special mentioned accounts sma stable breach of any covenant 3 sicr in facilities should be aligned with relevant macroeconomic variable outlook relevant early warning indicators macro and micro since stage assessment have material impact on provision requirement in our view fis should have currently many fis only use backstop and sma flag comprehensive staging policy to ensure accuracy of for sicr assessment for corporate customers rating credit risk assessment in timely manner this policy notch movement is also used but fis do not conduct should also be validated as part of the model internal analysis to identify pd threshold basis which validation exercise performed by the fi notch movement will be decided in our view fis should conduct an analysis to identify thresholds basis which notch movement 8 expected credit loss ecl 3 4 probability of default pd in general there are two types of pd through the cycle ttc pd which estimates the probability of default over a longer time horizon typically across the entire economic cycle it smoothens out the short term fluctuations in the economic environment by considering a full business cycle which includes periods of both economic growth and recession point in time pit pd which estimates the probability of default based on the current economic conditions and the borrower s present financial health it is more sensitive to the short term changes in the economy and the borrower s situation as per regulatory requirement fis need to use pit issues that we have noticed in the pd computation pd for ecl computation fis can compute either ttc which we think will not be in line with the industry pd and convert that to pit pd with macroeconomic practice overlay or directly compute pit term structure with not using data for an entire business cycle eight macroeconomic overlay basis remaining lifetime of to ten years or for at least five years even when the facility such data is available ecl guidelines are generally principal based and poor data quality with issues such as missing provide leeway to fis in selecting the methodology it values outliers and incorrect data are noted wants to adopt for computation purposes some of during model development phase the methodologies that fis can use to compute pd are some fis with multiple systems to record data does not have unique identifier to integrate the gross flow rate method data for a borrower new flow rate method fis using legacy rating scorecard models as application behaviour scorecard developed and implemented 10 15 years ago without conducting comprehensive model internal external rating based approach validation to ensure model output is appropriate pluto tasche approach fis using legacy models despite increase decrease vasicek single factor model in portfolio which might require further segmentation pooling analysis and update of markov chain models accordingly weibull model fis using vendor model which was developed credit index using only external data and or does not have adequate model development document or super panel hazard model validation to ensure model output is accurate asset based merton model fis using methodology which is not appropriate machine learning based models such as xgboost for the underlying portfolio segment in our view fis should select methodology as per our view fis should validate and redevelop or considering factors such as portfolio data availability recalibrate as required all the legacy both historic current and future economic data as rating scorecard models which were developed needed for that methodology using a single previously for irb or ecl disclosure purposes approach for all portfolios segments might not be in additionally fis should conduct comprehensive data line with the industry practice assessment and ensure quality and completeness of all critical data elements that are needed to additionally below we highlight some of the key compute pd expected credit loss ecl 9 3 5 loss given default lgd lgd is an estimate of loss from a facility in case a borrower defaults and can be estimated basis recoveries that can be made after default recoveries can be in the form of cash unsecured recovery or by possession or sale of collateral secured recoveries fis can use different method to compute lgd some of the methods that can be used are workout lgd market lgd asset pricing implied lgd where fi s internal data and where market price of where lgd is derived basis recovery is used for lgd defaulted instruments is used credit spreads on the non computation to estimate lgd defaulted risky bonds or credit derivatives such as cds quantitative models regulatory lgd where lgd is derived basis where regulatory prescribed methods such as linear unsecured lgd and collateral regressions fractional logistic haircuts are used to compute jacob frye and decision tree secured lgd models as mentioned earlier from pd perspective even for 4 in our experience fis can reduce lgd with lgd fis should select the methodology after effective collateral framework including collateral considering factors such as portfolio data availability allocation among different facilities of a both historic current and future economic data borrower and periodic fair valuation of data accuracy etc as needed below we highlight underlying collateral some other areas that fis should consider while 5 depending on methodology adopted fis should developing lgd models consider all the relevant parameters cost and 1 as per current market practice single unsecured discount rate to compute lgd lgd is computed which is applied for all facilities irrespective of stage or residual life of the facility as generally been noted lgd should increase basis credit risk i e lgd for accounts in stage three should be higher than for accounts in stage two similarly for stage three accounts also recovery drops as time elapses and thus accounts with higher vintage in default should have higher lgd for this fis can try to compute progressive lgd or lgd term structure so that appropriate lgd is used for ecl computation 2 fis can conduct vintage analysis to determine time period in which maximum recovery will occur and accordingly use data for that time period for lgd estimate fis can use methods like chain ladder to forecast lgd for recent default cases where recovery has not been completed 3 fis can also compute cure rate basis accounts which went in default but have paid all arrears and became standard within short period of time such as within three to six months 10 expected credit loss ecl 3 6 exposure at default ead as per global public policy committee gppc paper ecl which will impact p l statements by as published in june 2016 ead is an estimate of incorporating prepayments in ead fis can factor in the exposure at a future default date taking into principal repayment that borrower is expected to account expected changes in the exposure after the make over and above the contractual amount and reporting date including repayments of principal and thus reduce ecl charge for stage two accounts with interest and expected drawdowns on committed long residual lifetime fis can use methods such as facilities 3 thus ead should consider both principal 1 static models basis historical data and average of and future interest along with any amortisation and the same using conditional prepayment rate prepayment as expected in future cpr and single monthly mortality smm is as fis need to compute lifetime ecl for stage two used for prepayment modelling and stage three fis need to compute lifetime ead 2 dynamic models where other factors such as basis either contractual or behaviour maturity relevant risk characteristics and economic assessment of the facility additionally fis should conditions are considered for prepayment ensure that cash flow modelling for different modelling purposes such as alm financial reporting and other purposes are aligned 3 advanced models where advanced quantitative models such as hazard model or machine some of the other modelling aspects that need to be learning models are used for modelling done for ead modelling are in our view fis should model ead considering credit conversion factor ccf ecl framework above factors so that they can rationalise ecl and requires ecl to be computed for non funded are not over and under providing in terms of exposure such as letter of credit lc and letter of provisions guarantee lg for the same fis can use different methods to model ccf basis data availability 1 basis internal historical data using methods such as cohort approach or fixed horizon method 2 regression based model basis relevant factors 3 monte carlo simulation based models 4 machine learning based model such as k nearest neighbors knn and support vector machine svm 5 regulatory prescribed factors amortisation basis the capability of the ecl system implemented fis can use amortisation schedule as per contractual cash flows i e monthly quarterly or semi annually or annually as per terms as of now we have seen fis either do not use amortisation in ead computation or assume annual amortisation ecl computed under either of the approaches will be conservative depending upon the stage and residual maturity of the contract but fis will need strategic system or models on platforms such as r sas python which can handle large data set that is required to use actual cash flow or cash flow generated basis models prepayment incorporation of prepayment in ecl computation will help fis rationalise ead and in turn 3 the implementation of ifrs 9 impairment requirements by banks issued by the global public policy committee of representatives of the six largest accounting networks in june 2016 expected credit loss ecl 11 3 7 effective interest rate eir effective interest rate is the rate that exactly should compute ceir and for other assets it should discounts estimated future cash payments or compute eir the calculation of eir includes all fees receipts through the expected life or when transaction costs and all other premiums or appropriate a shorter period of the financial asset or discounts which are directly related to the acquisition financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a of financial assets below are some key financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial considerations for computation of eir liability as per the framework for poci assets fis how to evaluate whether amortisation of transaction cost fees will be on eir slm basis how to evaluate whether volume based incentives will form part of eir how to evaluate whether to use expected life vs contractual life e g housing loan instruments with call put options prepayment clause how to determine whether interest income expenses will be presented on gross basis how to compute eir for floating rate instruments 12 expected credit loss ecl 3 8 macroeconomic mev overlay and weighted ecl fis need to compute ecl considering historical information current economic conditions as well as future macroeconomic outlook additionally the framework requires fis to compute ecl under different macroeconomic forecast and compute weighted ecl basis different macroeconomic conditions some of the points that fis should note in selection and modelling for weighted ecl are listed below 01 02 fis can either forecast mev basis internal relevant macroeconomic models for models or use external forecast published different segments pools should be selected by reputable agencies basis quantitative and qualitative analysis 03 04 fis should select same variables as far as mev forecast for the variables should be used possible for ecl computation and other risk consistently in different risk purposes such as management and stress testing purposes alm and stress testing 05 06 rationale for weights used for different assumptions and limitations in selection macroeconomic scenarios should be and computation of forward looking ecl documented and validated as part of model should be identified and validated validation in our view not incorporating forecasted mev in ecl computation will not comply with the regulations fis should select relevant mev and incorporate these while modelling ecl 3 9 post model adjustment pmas and overlays post model adjustments and overlays are used where the risks and uncertainties cannot be correctly predicted or quantified basis model overlays are the adjustments made to the existing models output and these adjustments can be subjective or judgmental or at times both these risks are not captured by the models because they are not designed to address uncertainties such as those seen during the global financial crisis of 2007 08 covid 19 pandemic or recent interest rate hikes the key considerations for computation of pma and overlays are the approach for applying pmas should be appropriate and clearly understandable ensuring that these adjustments effectively address the limitations of the model the methodology for computing and applying pmas must be thoroughly documented there should be defined governance structure to incorporate such pmas fis should conduct back testing to validate for relevance and adequacy of pmas expected credit loss ecl 13 4 validation of the models as per rbi guidelines fis should have independent first line model developer and second line model three lines of defence to manage model risk and as validator have performed due diligence and per that all ecl models should be independently complied with all applicable internal policies and validated4 before deployment as well as periodically procedures as well as regulatory guidelines monitored and validated as per mrm policy of the model validator to conduct comprehensive check on fi 5 additionally entire process of model entire model development process and challenge development and validation has to be reviewed by model developer some of the key areas that internal audit third line of defence to ensure both validator should check are data complete data steps including extraction of data from various sources data massaging imputations and feature engineering as used to prepare modelling data should be assessed methodology model methodology should be assessed basis portfolio segment as well as regulatory requirement and industry benchmark assumptions and limitations all assumptions subjective or analytical and limitations in data methodology should be assessed along with rationale and any controls that are placed to mitigate risk arising from use of such assumptions and limitations documentation as mentioned in rbi guidelines model document should be detailed enough so that it provides good understanding of model to any independent reader implementation in case of any system or stand alone codes validator should assess robustness of system implementation or code development to ensure output from these is accurate controls validator should assess controls in ecl computation process to ensure no inadvertent changes are done in model which might result in inaccurate output overrides all the management overrides such as those in selection of variable in binning of score and weightage of variable should be validated along with their impact on model output sensitivity and back testing validator should conduct sensitivity and back testing analysis to test model robustness and accuracy of output and accordingly raise an issue in case the results are not in line with the expectations pma any overlay adjustments over and above the model output should be assessed by the validator to evaluate the need for such overlays and the appropriateness of methodology the validator shall also back test the adjustments to ensure that provisions are adequate overall in our view fis should have independent ai ml based model or advanced statistical models or model validation team or hire external consultants for simple average based model will be different and who will perform validation of these models both can be defined in model validation policy as pre deployment as well as going forward prescribed in rbi draft circular on model risk additionally depending on the methodology used management in credit such validation rigor will also for modelling of various components rigor and tests be applicable for third party or consultant developed will vary for example validation requirement for models 4 model risk management issued by kpmg in india in november 2024 5 draft circular regulatory principles for management of model risks in credit issued by the reserve bank of india in august 2024 14 expected credit loss ecl 5 key challenges below are the key challenges grouped into different categories that we have noticed while assisting different fis globally in their journey of ifrs9 indas109 asc 326 implementation and subsequent validation data basis our experience data is biggest challenge for ecl computation some of the data challenges we noticed are in terms of historical data availability data quality data integration across various systems data volume and lack of availability of critical data in digital format in the system due to such issues many fis go for regulatory backstop for different components which might result in conservative ecl estimation methodology many fis do not select model methodology basis availability of volume and quality of data or considering process it and people capability in our view using appropriate methodology is critical in having robust ecl framework and thus it is selected after due considerations on various aspects also to avoid undue volatility in provisions model methodology selected should be robust and should not require frequent changes process ecl computation requires coordination among different departments and thus having robust process for entire ecl computations i e data extractions model running computation and reporting is critical additionally as the numbers are reported in financial statements any delay or break in the process might result in inaccurate or delay in statements which might impact reputation of the fi implementing target operating model tom and business as usual bau process requires a lot of deliberation among different stakeholders people having adequate resources in different departments with relevant knowledge and experience is critical both during development of framework and as part of bau many a times we find that fis have key man risk in critical departments fis can take help of consultants as and when required for this purpose it system many fis still rely on spreadsheets for ecl computation which might not be optimum given the volume of data that needs to be processed for both computation of different components and final ecl estimates at each reporting date in our view fis should invest in either strategic or tactical system depending on volume of data that is expected to be handled expected credit loss ecl 15 governance and controls defining appropriate governance with clear roles and responsibilities for all the stakeholders is critical and requires deliberations with different teams also appropriate turnaround time tat and escalation matrix should also be defined so that there is no delay in financial reporting additionally as the numbers are reported in the financial statements designing and implementing effective controls for the entire ecl framework process became paramount mis there is no mis report dashboard so that senior management have adequate oversight on movement of ecl provisions and can intervene in timely manner before provisions breach risk thresholds in our view fis should assess all such areas to ensure they have robust ecl framework which can work efficiently as part of bau process additionally there should be clear plan on how any gaps and challenges will be addressed within stipulated timelines to emphasise again as ecl provisions need to be reported in the financial statements along with change in provision at each reporting date fis should strive to have robust ecl framework so that volatility in provisions is reduced which will give confidence to regulators shareholders potential investors and other stakeholders 16 expected credit loss ecl 6 key impacted areas in our experience ecl implementation will not only any major failure might have adverse impact complete credit lifecycle but also other reputational impact also as ecl provisions will functions and departments and thus it is imperative need to be disclosed on each reporting date any that different stakeholders understand the undue increase in provisions might also create requirements and enhance process accordingly key reputational risk event for the fi areas that will be directly impacted are listed below 8 risk appetite and limits as provisions will 1 pricing as ecl impact need to be recorded in the impact financial statements it is imperative that books from day one it is imperative that fis fis should update risk appetite and limit factor in such cost while pricing the loans in our framework to minimise impact of provisions on view fis should implement risk based pricing the fi also this framework should be dynamic with expected provision as one of the factors in and should be updated basis factors such as determining the rate of interest at which it will macroeconomic conditions strategic visions and offer loans to the borrower business focus 2 liquidity as provisions will hit p l increase in 9 stress testing fis should add relevant provisions will result in reduced profitability and scenarios sensitivities that will impact ecl retained earnings which will directly impact provisions as part of stress test framework capital available with the fis and will impact 10 other fair value regulations as ecl framework liquidity ratios such as liquidity coverage ratio comes into effect other regulatory requirements lcr and net stable funding ratio nsfr this such as disclosures ifrs7 indas 107 and might result in impact on capital and funds regulation related to fv hierarchy ifrs13 indas requirement planning of the fis and they may 113 may also come into effect these require raising capital from alternate methods regulations will on one hand increase 3 alm as ecl framework requires computation of transparency in reporting but on another hand it provisions on future cash flows any increase in also increases compliance requirements provisions will reduce assets and might create in our view fis should perform a holistic review of asset liability mismatch additionally fis may ecl computations and its impact on various face potential mismatch in case different functions accordingly fis can plan to address any assumptions for cash flow modelling such as gaps and high impact areas which might be at risks prepayment and amortisation are used for ecl once ecl framework is implemented computation and alm 4 operational as ecl computation will require significant modelling and system requirement this increases chance of operational risk event such as system failure manual error and regulatory or auditor finding on framework 5 icaap with high reliance on models to compute ecl provisions there will be increase in model risk faced by fis which may qualify as material risk under pillar 2 of icaap exercise in that scenario fis will need to consider it while performing icaap assessment and might need to maintain certain capital under the framework 6 regulatory compliance basis our experience ecl provisions always qualify as material risk for both statutory auditor and regulator and will be the focus area of both the auditor and the regulator any issue identified in the process might create a compliance issue 7 reputation as there are many areas that will be impacted by implementation of ecl framework eexxppeecctteedd ccrreeddiitt lloossss eeccll 1177 7 conclusion as highlighted in this paper ecl provisions requirements will not only impact credit department but all other aspects of business and risk management of the fis thus it is imperative that fis should design tom in such a way that the framework is robust as well as optimise provision as a part of bau process key points that fis should note for such frameworks are every process takes time to settle and thus it is advisable that fis to conduct multiple dry runs of proposed framework and enhance as per gaps identified identify all gaps and challenges and put in place a plan to resolve them the plan should be tracked at central level with involvement of senior management allocate adequate resources both human and capital to design and implement the framework key

enabling healthcare workers to spend more time with patients the sector may also be missing a valuable way to grow their data maturity here because data management and integration have been the top advantages gained from xaas technologies over the past 12 months averaged across all sectors but in a sector where data security and data privacy are so pressing this elevated level of caution and lack of proactivity in relation to xaas and cloud solutions are understandable in the absence of clearer guidance on data in the cloud from regulatory authorities many healthcare organizations will

policies for growth of evs there is need for two key initiatives to support the highways or expressways and transport development of charging infrastructure authorities can evaluate land at inter state bus terminals airports etc to enable charging standardization and right location it is estimated facility for visitors cabs e buses etc in that 7 15 utilization is sufficient to achieve the addition there is need to enable single viability for a charging station factoring in window clearance and online transparent aspects such as location and target vehicle mix1 approval for setting up cpo especially for while the utilization will increase from current low highways and expressways single digit with the growth in ev sales this process can be further aided by allowing private e bus operators access to state transport undertaking depots for parking establishing common standards for and charging basis pay per use model connectors across vehicle categories delay in currently private operators park buses on the establishing such standards is preventing roadside due to unavailability of overnight interoperability interoperability will allow parking facilities this cannot work in case of e existing charging stations to serve more evs buses as they need to charge overnight for the and help achieve higher utilization this next trip hence such access is key to enable standardization will also improve the electrification in buses given private sector experience of ev owners and address their accounts for over 80 of buses in the country4 range anxiety to an extent upfront cost reduction public entities are allowed selecting right locations for new charging to provide land to cpos on a revenue sharing stations the need for more charging stations model through a bidding process with floor price is primarily concentrated in select urban of inr 1 kwh payment for land use2 this is a centers highways and expressways the significant step in addressing unfavorable unit guidelines from government on charging economics of charging stations the unit infrastructure allow public entities to provide economics can be further improved for cpos if land to cpos2 besides this there is a need to public entities can bear the cost of preparing the identify which land parcels of public entities upstream infrastructure like transformer and will be suitable for setting up charging stations electricity connection at the identified locations and ensure utilization required for viability as particularly at highways or expressways where example discoms can evaluate their

burden is also higher due to 10 24 months duty structure at present in evs there are also shorter loan duration and 1 8 higher interest limited and unfavorable financing options available rate5 government can encourage affordable in case of evs when compared to ice vehicles financing by hence there is need for two key initiatives adding evs to priority sector lending list for parity in gst structure gst on ev components banks6 public sector banks can first take lead currently ranges between 18 to 28 whereas it is in helping psus transition their fleets to evs 5 for evs1 the consistent 5 gst structure this will allow public banks necessary across ev components and evs will help address exposure before venturing into ev financing three key issues promoting partnerships between financiers the disparity in input and output tax is and new age companies resulting in working capital blockage for financiers currently face difficulty in oems as they have to wait for obtaining underwriting loans because ev resale refund for additional tax paid as per input tax market is yet to develop further they have credit under gst2 3 limited knowledge of battery technology current structure inadvertently disincentives which accounts for 40 50 of ev cost4 as battery as a service and battery leasing well as impact of vehicle running pattern businesses given they have to pay 18 gst temperature and quality of road on the for standalone battery compared to 5 for battery life battery with ev4 new age companies are involved in leasing replacement batteries become costlier for ev battery or offering battery as a service to owners customers partnerships with companies can help financiers de link the battery cost affordable financing the current ev financing is from the ev cost this would mitigate asset primarily driven by few nbfcs with some risk for financiers and also improve loan participation from banks in addition to this the terms for the customers loan terms available on evs are not on par when compared to loan terms available on ice vehicles supporting new age companies involved in ev owners are currently paying significantly battery as a service and battery leasing with higher initial down payment due to 30 45 higher favorable taxation as well as relaxed upfront cost with respect to comparative ice investment norms note a sales summation 4w evs

control and exhaust system while the powertrain of evs requires battery pack electric motor and r d there is need to ensure talent development other components such as charger converter for niche jobs with focus on r d this requires battery management system and thermal revamping engineering curriculums to include management system1 courses on battery technologies battery chemicals battery recycling and much more after sales elements such as repair and replacement will continue to be relevant but the government can mandate universities for required frequency of these elements is lower in required course development and inclusions case of evs in addition the technical know how allocation of budget by government needed for servicing evs is also higher due to the universities on ev technologies involvement of electronics driven components the perception with respect to evs among public new entrants there are multiple new entrants to also requires enhancement there is need to address the value chain including cathode active material concerns with respect to difference in cost of evs manufactures battery cell manufacturers battery and ice vehicles scope of re sale in evs safety of recyclers power distribution companies charging batteries during summers and much more equipment suppliers charge point operators etc government can leverage two key enablers considering these shifts it is important to ensure marketing campaigns in 2021 government had that there are limited job losses by enabling launched go electric campaign to educate transition towards new type of job opportunities public on evs3 similar initiatives or efforts are hence there is need for targeted trainings and skill needed on sustained basis they could highlight development with respect to testimonials of ev owners and their travel to far operations and maintenance there is need to off locations via evs or introduce a website educate fleet drivers about best practices such as featuring
